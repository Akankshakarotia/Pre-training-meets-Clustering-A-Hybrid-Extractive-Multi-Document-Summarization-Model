0,"["" In little more than a week, the world's leaders will converge on this  businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting  of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum."", 'They could hardly  be meeting in a more provocative place.', 'On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued  trading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls  on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly  on investment from overseas.', 'In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister,  Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy  that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion.', ""Mahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy-  makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would  retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out  when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise."", ""Now, though,  Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate  that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund  economy."", ""Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and  there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again."", ""``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls,  the economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director  of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research  organization here that helped draft the policies."", ""``But we want to  see whether this is strongly sustainable.''"", ""Critics said it was predictable  that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy."", 'Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows  and currency fluctuations, they said, the government had been able  to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending.', ""Still, the  mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results  guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting."", 'With  Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital controls will  have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin  of Westerners.', ""``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,''  said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore."", ""``There is  no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to  muzzle him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China."", ""Policy-makers  in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit  is seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the  region, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it."", 'So far, Indonesian  officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised  by the International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity  and open markets.', ""But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy  for Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, has advocated using them as an emergency  measure."", ""Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention  that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial  system."", 'He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge  fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive  consequences.', 'The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in  Greenwich, Conn., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on  Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted  a flight of capital out of that country.', ""``The LTCM fiasco really  provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,''  Yusof said."", 'With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia  was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy.', 'In addition to  growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade  balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods.', 'Foreign investors  have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as experts had predicted  they would.', 'While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to  $142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the  period from January through September _ it did not dry up completely.', 'For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarming  one.', ""They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely  due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian  currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated  by Sept. 30."", 'The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in  September, despite several reductions in interest rates.', 'So the consumers  who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into  their savings, which means the buying spree will end when their savings  are depleted.', ""``The argument was that by imposing capital controls,  you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the  supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch,'' said K.S."", 'Jomo,  a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here.', ""``But that's not happening.''"", ""The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy,  Jomo and others said, is its timing."", 'With the Asian crisis more than  a year old, much of the foreign capital that was in the country has  already gone.', 'The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors  without even locking in the ones who used to be here.', ""``There is a  case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls,  but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one,'' Jomo said."", 'In fact,  other Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht,  have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency  and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar.', 'Analysts  liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that  has come and gone.', 'More important, the capital controls are slowing  down much-needed corporate and banking reforms.', ""The government's rescue  of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is going  ahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually  scrap the much-criticized plan."", 'The rescue of politically connected  companies remains a tense issue here.', ""On Monday, during the trial  of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges  of corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's  claim that he had approved the bailout."", ""Anwar's sensational trial  is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled  from politics."", ""Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with  his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he  dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls."", 'During boom  times, Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner  language.', ""In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying  foreign currency traders ``are the cause of the currency turmoil,''  adding: ``They spread it worldwide."", ""They precipitated the current  recession in every country.''"", ""But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has  stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia."", ""With  protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this  city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order  to soothe the country's agitated population."", ""``Things will heat up  if the economy does not improve,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor  of political science at the University of Malaya."", ""``Then the whole  question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue.''"", 'In  that regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in  two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host.', ""Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region  advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms  in their effort to restore stability."", 'Among the necessary steps is  for countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make  them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests, the  officials suggested.', ""The deputy finance ministers and deputy central  bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila  Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote  regional economic stability."", ""Many of Asia's economies have plunged  into recession since that agreement."", ""Collapsed currencies, weakened  demand and higher unemployment now characterize a region that once  boasted some of the world's highest economic growth rates."", ""The worsening  financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week's summit  in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation forum."", 'The summit is to take place on Nov. 17-18.', ""In a  joint statement, the officials cited risks including slower global  growth, with particular mention of Russia's worsening economy, and  the need to speed up social programs to help the poor in the worst-hit  countries."", 'Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International  Monetary Fund, noted that some countries have already reformed their  banking sectors.', 'But he stressed the need for corporate restructuring  as well.', ""``These are not easy things to do,'' he said."", ""Meanwhile,  Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that the country's prime  minister would declare ``a state of emergency'' after the APEC meeting  ends in Kuala Lumpur, a report said Sunday."", ""Former Deputy Prime Minister  Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct,  made the warning in an interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine."", ""Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September, saying he  was morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from Malaysia's ruling  party."", ""Anwar denies the allegations and says they were fabricated  because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister's  17-year rule."", 'The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world  leaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.', 'Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample  local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit.', ""It's expected to be a hot affair."", ""Spicy delicacies on the menu are  satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik,  chicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and  fried rice ``village-style,'' the Star newspaper reported in Monday  editions."", 'Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia  Marsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the leaders  were expected to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18.', 'APEC groups Australia,  Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,  Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,  Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.', 'Russia, Vietnam  and Peru will also join APEC this year.', ""Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic  planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry  said Friday."", ""Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders  summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation  from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said."", 'Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the  understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an annual formality  that allows Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host  to avoid controversy with China.', ""Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's  annual meeting if Lee attends has forced him to send a stand-in every  year since the inaugural summit in 1993."", 'China claims Taiwan as a  breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed  to send their heads of state.', 'APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,  Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore,  Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.', 'Russia, Vietnam and Peru will  join in November.', ""The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement  for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next  month in a case that will test the country's legal system."", ""Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any  time."", ""But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's  job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision  was not expected quickly."", ""The party leaders, who have been conducting  a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar  was fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High  Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence."", ""The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday,  aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform has  the most appeal."", 'Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had  groomed Anwar, 51, as his successor.', 'But he fired his protege from  his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds  he was morally unfit to lead.', 'The two had differed over economic policy  and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year  rule.', ""Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks  of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and  Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows police  to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and  lawyers."", 'On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked  by the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent  weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government.', 'Baton-wielding  riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons,  arresting more than 100 people.', ""``They decided that the government  should be brought down through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama  news agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island."", 'He was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the  UMNO meeting.', 'After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised  face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly  from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised  the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia  next month.', ""The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's  visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated,  the Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying."", 'Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum.', 'Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered  hospital checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four  charges of abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation.', 'His trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings.', 'He has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another corruption  count and five charges of sodomy.', 'He faces 14 years in prison and  a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each  sexual charge, if convicted.', 'Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the  Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial.', 'Under the  same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates  and a risk to national security.', 'As of Tuesday, 12 had been released.', ""The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top candidates  for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision."", 'The Star newspaper,  which is close to the government, listed the favorites as Foreign  Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak.', ""Other top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin,  a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as  ``special functions minister'' in charge of economic recovery."", 'Rafidah  Aziz, the

successor to Malaysia's long-serving  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad."", 'But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir  on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.', 'He then began  speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.', 'Anwar has  been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia  law, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political  persecution.', ""In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised  and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international  attention to his case."", ""``Because of human rights

'``Our proposals  would result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million  and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000.', ""Unfortunately,  the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration  to what we have offered.''"", 'Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic  projections, and shot down a number of new proposals presented to  the players on Sept. 25.', ""``If they had left the current deal in place,  we would have gotten much of that anyway,'' he added."", ""``All we're  saying is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap.''"", ""Monday's  decision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the  NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week  of exhibition games."", 'Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated  that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35  million and $40 million.', 'Decisions about the cancellations of regular  season games are expected to be made next week, he added.', 'A league  official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two  weeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations.', ""Thursday's  bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the  season on time."", ""``Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have  no reason to believe they will on Thursday,'' Granik said."", ""Added Hunter:  ``Of course they don't expect much to get done."", 'When Russ and David  decide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive, then  something will happen.', ""What they're banking on now is that the players  are going to miss paychecks and cave in November."", ""It's as if they've  ingested something that has to pass."", ""And once it passes, then they'll  negotiate.''"", ""More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed  contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during  the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that  may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have  major ramifications on American sports-labor law."", 'But neither the  players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator,  John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds  in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million  in salaries.', 'NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the  decision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated  by appealing to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if  necessary, to the 2nd U.S.', 'Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that  could prevent the players from getting paid for several months.', 'The  NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season  because of the labor dispute.', 'The league has other litigation pending  in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.', 'If the players win the ruling,  the NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick.', 'The motion  was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining  agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the  matter.', ""``If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit  and the resolve of the players,'' said Billy Hunter, union executive  director."", ""``But we understand that won't end the lockout."", 'It just  means they have to pay 200-some players.', 'And there is still other  litigation alive that may take a while to resolve.', ""At most, it's a  hollow victory.''"", 'Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render  his decision.', 'Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully.', 'There is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid.', 'During the  NBA summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file  a grievance.', 'Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked  out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season.', 'The union argued  that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses  about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player  contracts.', 'In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses  in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding  payment during a lockout.', 'The league is relying on the basic tenets  of labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes  or lockouts.', 'A ruling for the union would be significant for all future  negotiations between players and owners.', 'The deterrent factor of a  lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement  do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to  reach a new agreement.', 'If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there  will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts  to reach an agreement quickly.', 'They would essentially be paid for  not playing basketball.', 'If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the  reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement  more quickly.', ""But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference  call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled  before the players would back away from their ultimate goals."", ""``I'm  not at all concerned,'' Hunter said."", ""``There's been no demonstration  that there's going to be a change in our resolve."", ""After the players  saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA  owners, well, I had two players call me up and tell me, if need be,  they'd be willing to hock everything they've got.''"", 'Another significant  development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the  dispute is settled, according to at least two player agents.', ""``I think  it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people  talking about that,'' said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's  agents advisory committee."", 'Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee,  said he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center  Rony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece.', ""``We  wouldn't look to void his deal with the team,'' Kauffman said."", ""``But  we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until  he could come back and honor his contract.'"", ""Russ Granik, NBA deputy  commissioner, said the league has approved the idea of players' earning  a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled."", 'Proposals exchanged  last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player  salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations  since the lockout began July 1.', ""But both sides have termed the figures  in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it was unclear whether  either side was willing compromise."", ""``I don't think we should get  too carried away about the possibilities just yet,'' Granik said."", '``When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the  players at their word that they wanted to make some headway.', 'But to  call their first proposal meaningless is charitable.', 'They proposed  something that has no impact.', ""As it stands, that can't be the solution.''"", ""The owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation  to leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players  want to keep earning as much as possible."", 'As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball  Association and its players is weird even by sports standards.', 'There  is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season  will be canceled.', 'In this union battle it is the interests of the  best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the  discussion.', 'And here it is some of the workers, not the management,  who are considering trying to make the union disappear.', 'The current  arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions.', 'Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum,  then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans.', 'The number of  players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class,  in NBA terms _ fell sharply.', 'But Michael Jordan made $33 million.', 'This should not be a surprise.', 'Sports is an entertainment business,  not unlike movies.', 'Big stars get millions, while most get union scale.', 'Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed.', 'The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its  own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay.', 'When that was adopted,  it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could  pay.', 'But it has not worked out that way.', 'In the current negotiation,  the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20  percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion,  and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players  want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises  for veterans.', 'The union says it is worried about that middle class,  but seems determined to preserve the free market.', ""The league got its  broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay  this year's television fees whether or not there are any games to  broadcast."", '(They will be paid back in later years, either through  reduced fees or extra games to show.)', 'Owners hoped the players would  think management was willing to wait them out, and come to terms with  only a small part of the season canceled.', 'But the union is acting  unhurried.', 'It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying  the players had to meet first.', 'Then there is the issue of union suicide,  a tactic that was rejected by the players in 1995.', 'The idea is that  if the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws  for the owners to collude.', 'The sky would be the limit.', 'That tactic  might fail.', 'The courts could reject a union decertification vote as  a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel  free to offer less than the old union minimum.', 'But if the players  go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get  going.', ""Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners  this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity."", ""That was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World  Series was canceled by labor troubles."", 'But fan memories are relatively  short, and now baseball seems more popular than ever.', 'With that in  mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months.']","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more

support, or  perhaps because people are simply fed up.', 'But, in more characteristic  fashion, her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing.', 'Colleagues of Starovoitova declared _ without any apparent evidence  _ that her Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament,  were the most likely culprits in her death.', ""Historian Dmitry Likachyov,  one of the nation's most revered and trusted figures, said her killing  seemed to signal the ``outburst of a new Red Terror.''"", 'By late Saturday,  the name-calling had gone so far that Interior Minister Sergei

too early to know where the recriminations  and political maneuvering will lead.', 'For now, the only thing certain  is the Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian  martyrs.', 'A

4,"[' Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feuds and shifting  alliances.', 'And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled  government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve.', ""A  leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist  Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision  to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender  majority in Parliament."", ""``Prodi must realize that his majority no  longer exists,'' said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding  Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after  they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union  in 1991."", ""``Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the  last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis.''"", 'Cossuta  was clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party  in withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded as having  torpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50 years.', 'But the  leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti,  seems to have no such compunctions.', 'On Friday, he told journalists  that he was not worried about forcing new elections that could return  the right to power.', ""``Sometimes you have to take one step back in  order to take two steps forward,'' he said with a shrug."", 'Until now,  however, the communist rank and file have disagreed with that view.', 'When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over  proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced  to backpedal.', 'Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  and coalition leaders to devise a strategy.', 'He is expected to go to  Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough  votes for the budget.', 'Without it, the Italian central bank is unlikely  to cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do to get in line  with Germany and other bigger European neighbors before the introduction  Jan. 1 of the single European currency, the euro.', 'But even if he gathers  enough votes to pass the budget, Prodi could still be left without  a majority.', 'After two and a half years in office, his government is  the second-longest in the postwar era.', 'But the fragile center-left  coalition has held together mostly because Italians were united for  the last two years in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and  government borrowing to meet the requirements for membership in the  euro plan.', 'Once that goal was achieved last spring, dissension quickly  revived.', ""Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist  Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the  coalition."", 'If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choices.', 'He  can resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bringing  the opposition to power.', 'Or he could seek to form a new majority without  the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right  party of Francesco Cossiga.', ""Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue  in June, when the hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO  expansion."", 'But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with  the center-left majority that elected him in 1996.', 'Cossiga also suggested  to reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations to join  a coalition led by Prodi.', ""``We wouldn't want this majority to get  stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress,'' he said."",

government of technocrats.', 'If Scalfaro  feels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call  early elections.', 'Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament  during the last six weeks of his term, elections would have to be  scheduled by December.', 'Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier  for the interim.', ""Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked  the crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999  deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to stimulate  job creation."", ""Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists,  who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence  by a single vote."", ""Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless  his new government could stick to

Ohio  are also aiding Voinovich.', 'The northern half of the state, with its  history of industrial, unionized cities, has a tradition of voting  largely for Democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the  state is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican.', 'But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving  Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic  candidates.', 'Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers  to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland.', 'And Voinovich, a former

demilitarized  zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to  break out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects,  in return for billions in Western energy aid.', ""Yet Washington has never  called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive  regime."", 'His government, taking a page out of the Saddam playbook,  suggested last week that if the United States really wants to look  at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a nuclear installation  in the making, it should write a check for another $300 million.', ""No  one even called for Kim's removal when, a few months ago, he lobbed  a three-stage missile over Japan just to show he knew how."", ""``The rules  for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky,''

Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it  helps if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point  to.''"", ""Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely  a ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler  of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who was President  George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam  nowadays is simply ``an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem,  but not a threat to the region at the moment'')."", 'Mahathir, however,  is far more complex case.', ""He's a prime example of

have outlived their usefulness."", 'Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and  Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear was  that Malaysia would become a communist domino.', 'But he also seemed  eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over.', 'He has never  been accused of enormous corruption.', ""He turned his country into a  model of

missile.''"", 'In his speech, Clinton pointed  to recent North Korean missile tests, incursions into the south and  a mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapons installation  as signs of the potential threat.', ""And he compared North Korea to Iraq,  saying that North Korea was ``also a major concern'' because of its  chemical and biological weapons."", ""Until North Korea ``fully commits  itself to a constructive role on this peninsula,'' he said, ``we must  remain ready.''"", ""Clinton restated his support for Kim's policy of engagement  with North Korea, though, saying that there were ``some hopeful signs''  to justify it."", 'He pointed to talks that began over the summer between  the American military command in Korea and the North Korean military  to prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between the south  and north.', 'Clinton planned to leave South Korea early Monday and return  to Washington Monday night, after paying a visit to Guam.', 'On a bright

 However, indications of a revived North Korean nuclear program clouded President Clinton's ""economics and security"" Asian trip.
 North Korea's economy is bad, malnutrition widespread, yet the country maintains a 1.1 million military force.
 Past US food and fuel aid to that country has been based on it not promoting a nuclear program.
 The US policy on Iraq is the removal of Saddam Hussein.
 Now, apparently the US supports dumping PM Mahathir Mohamed in Malaysia.

9,"[' Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sat  down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya.', ""He was worried,  he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa  network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a  worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans."", 'The organization,  the author complained, had declared war against the United States,  yet he had learned of that only from the news media.', 'The writer, who  federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one  of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi  a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest  of an aide to bin Laden.', ""Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said  he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden,  seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''"", 'He said the Americans  were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that  he had to take precautions.', ""``The cell is at 100 percent danger,''  the operative warned."", 'The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital  evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer  in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed  in U.S. District Court in New York City.', 'The papers said the computer  was seized in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authorities that was  attended by an FBI agent.', 'The documents did not make clear whether  the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings  of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug.  7 of this year.', 'The timing is potentially important because there  have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the  United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist  attack on American targets in Kenya.', ""Officials of the FBI and the  U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night  at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they  make any other comment."", 'Fazil eluded American investigators after  the bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands  and then to the Middle East.', 'He remains a fugitive.', 'The dispatch provides  a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the  twilight of the 20th century.', 'The author talks of how he and his fellow  operatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate.', 'He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East  Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on  big decisions.', ""Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document  seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against  bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that  his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's  door by federal authorities _ the attacks on American soldiers in  Somalia in 1993 and 1994."", ""The writer of the document warned that the  followers of bin Laden, whom he referred to as ``the sheik,'' had  ``become America's primary target.''"", ""He said his comrades in East  Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence  activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of  the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows  well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's  cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''"", ""``They know that  since Kenya was the main gateway for those members, there must be  a center in Kenya,'' he wrote, concluding: ``We are really in danger.''"", ""The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare  and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants."", ""Federal  authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of  bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about  the ``security'' situation of the cell."", 'Fawwaz, who served as an informal  press spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities  in September after the embassy bombings.', 'He has denied any connection  to terrorist activities.', 'A translation of the report was part of a  package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to  support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York.', 'It is not  clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded  to bin Laden.', 'The documents, which were initially filed in secret,  include a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with  bin Laden to kill Americans overseas.', 'A second count charges him with  soliciting others to do so.', 'The report made clear that the organization  was being run on a shoestring.', 'Its author wrote that his mother has  fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a  visit.', '``What do you think?', ""Keep in mind we only have $500.''"", 'He repeatedly  expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was  in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates.', ""``There is a war and the situation is dangerous,'' he said."", 'He wrote  that American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national  security or American citizens.', 'The author noted with alarm a recent  CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees  had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United  States for trial.', 'According to federal authorities, Fazil went on  to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy.', ""Prosecutors  assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed  the embassy's security precautions."", 'On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil  drove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way for a vehicle  carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans.', ""The author of the report said that he stood ready to ``fight the forces  of atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth.''"", ""He said that  the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all  its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground  for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi."", ""``We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about the  operations plans,'' he wrote, `` since we are just implementers.''"", 'If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings  of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already  clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior  aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years.', 'The  government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym  CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret  proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.', 'According to the government,  the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period  when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks  on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.', 'From the court papers filed  in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August,  it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to  federal investigators.', 'They have cited the source in the papers filed  to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are  under arrest in Germany and Britain.', 'Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is  thought to be living in Afghanistan.', 'The source is also the basis  for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin  Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks  on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear  weapons.', 'It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere,  or hiding under government protection.', 'As recently as 11 days ago,  records show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New  York notary summarizing his allegations against bin Laden.', ""Government  officials adamantly declined to say anything about the identity of  CS-1, which stands for ``confidential source.''"", ""But at least one operative  of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago  that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman  who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives."", ""The operative's concerns  were inflamed by a report in a British newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating  with Saudi and U.S. authorities."", ""In an August, 1997 article, The Daily  Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May  and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts  and businesses."", ""The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East  African operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's  commanders, ``almost made me explode."", ""``An important man with close  links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands,  and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against  that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security  concerns."", 'Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and  remains at large.', 'The report was typed on a computer seized last year  by Kenyan authorities, according to a government filing last week  in U.S. district court in Manhattan.', ""Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have  charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist  activities or conspiracy."", ""In one recent filing, they said their case  will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source,  suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of  bin Laden or his associates."", 'The arrangement appears to have resulted  from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of  receiving a lesser sentence.', 'There is no indication that the source  has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take  place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.', 'In  the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading  guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed  from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified.', ""The source described taking ``an oath of allegiance'' to follow bin  Laden's orders, and gave a detailed account of bin Laden's group,  including its history and inner workings."", 'The source told of private  statements by bin Laden to other al Qaeda members, encouraging them  to attack U.S. troops and other citizens stationed in the Middle East  and Africa.', ""``I either heard these statements myself,'' the source  said, ``or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members.''"", ""The government has also said in other court papers that the source  helped identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document urging Muslims  to kill Americans."", ""Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not  be reached for comment."", 'The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a  Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month  to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind  of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to  U.S. intelligence officials.', 'The evidence, the officials said last  week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical  plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic  Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there  of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.', 'Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives  money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his  terror network, the officials added.', ""This evidence was uncovered after  the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following  the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said."", 'A spokesman  for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either  to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.', 'In a statement provided  by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely  no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in  the world.', ""I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with  him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with  him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''"", 'U.S. officials  say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi  presence in Sudan since the missile attack.', 'Officials said they were  not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum.', 'But intelligence  agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa  plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the  chemical weapons program.', 'In addition, a soil sample that the CIA  clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical  used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq.', 'The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his  decision to strike the Shifa plant.', 'Some State Department and CIA  officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based  on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden.', 'The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States  has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since  1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.', 'In addition, more than  100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn  in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications.', 'That year  a second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one  against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his  reports proved impossible to confirm.', ""Senior administration officials  say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence  of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program,  but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort."", 'Now they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their  initial suspicions about Al Shifa.', 'At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise  missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they  did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory.', ""The CIA, which had  begun to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's  ownership was irrelevant."", ""``What we knew about the ownership was that  a lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S.  intelligence official."", 'Still, after the missile strike, when Idris  was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate  his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism.', 'A Sudanese  expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously  a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia.', 'He bought the Shifa plant in March.', 'Officials say U.S. intelligence  has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic  groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is  40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government  entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons  development.', 'Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial  Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production,  and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against  U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.', ""But Pendry  denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial  Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about  the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad."", ""But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin  Laden's terrorist campaign."", ""One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on  Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants  as possible, administration officials now acknowledge."", 'According to  the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the  months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal  under U.S. and international law.', ""The officials said the raid was  timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps  at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would  be meeting there with his chief operatives."", 'A 1976 executive order  bars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying  out assassinations.', ""But officials said the White House legal opinion  drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority  to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking  Americans."", ""A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that  the infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly ``human.''"", ""``As  we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to  disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden  terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman  for the National Security Council at the White House."", 'Targeting infrastructure,  officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of  a terrorist group.', ""``Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable  target,'' Leavy said."", 'Senior administration officials said they never  discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions.', 'His death,  they said in interviews after the attack, would simply have been a  side benefit.', 'U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that  bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears  to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.', 'Officials said there  were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have  died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were  between 50 and 100.', 'Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction  between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking  a group of people who command a terrorist organization.', 'Administration  officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill  bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors  with leading a global war against U.S. interests.', 'He has been linked  to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.', ""But a  less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary  William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United  States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues."", ""``We  weren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent a message.''"", 'Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not  retracted his statements.', 'The Los Angeles Times recently reported  that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use  deadly force against terrorist leaders.', ""Bin Laden's organization was  a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the  bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa."", 'Last spring, officials  said, U.S. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan  to capture the Saudi exile.', 'Officials said that at roughly the same  time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military  attacks against a terrorist leadership.', 'That review, officials said,  provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the  meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would  be gathered.', 'The review, by the National Security Council, was the  basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order  banning assassinations.', 'That ban was imposed by President Ford in  1975, after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the  CIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and  others.', ""The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf  of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage  in, assassination.''"", 'While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified  ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over  the years.', 'In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist  attack against U.S. soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya.', 'The targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi.', 'And in the Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs in an attempt  to kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq.', 'The legal review conducted  by the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future  operations in similar

arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send  an important message.', 'Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict.', ""It was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993,  when the commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of trucks  to the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that  Srebrenica would be a ``safe area'' and the United Nations would protect  them."", 'But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica  with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs marched  in, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off.', ""``Srebrenica  signaled the massive failure of the West,'' said Daalder."", ""``It galvanized  the United States and NATO to act.''"", 'At a London conference later  in July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and remaining safe areas with  massive air strikes if necessary.', 'After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo  marketplace in late August, NATO air strikes began,

political  settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy.', ""Macedonia's government  Wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 NATO troops near its  border with Kosovo."", 'Those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid  of the civilian monitors if necessary.', 'Some of the closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict,  to the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred  near this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children  and elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian  forces, their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor.', 'Piecing  together what happened, from surviving family members, ethnic Albanian  separatist forces and official Serbian information, a story emerges  of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery  and infantry.', 'The Serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered  unusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, took  revenge against the civilians, shooting women and children at close  range as they tried to run away from their pursuers.', 'According to  relatives who found the bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, was decapitated,  his brain left on display on the ground.', 'Hava Delijaj, 65, was shot  and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of  skin.', 'Young women and children who had run a few hundred yards up  a rocky path were mowed down.', 'Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie,  was found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije,  30, more than 24 hours after the killings.', ""``Blood was in her mouth  and her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father,  an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian  guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies."", '``I  moved her hand and at that moment she opened her eyes.', 'I realized  she was alive.', ""I tried to clean the blood from her mouth and she put  her tongue out.''"", 'Several members of the Delijaj clan survived.', 'Zejnije  Delijaj, 39, who had cooked for the guerrillas at the family compound  when they returned from fighting in the days before the massacre,  recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding in the  woods as the Serbs shot at her.', ""``I could feel the dirt hitting me  from the impact of the bullets,'' she said in an interview, her nose  still bloodied from what she said was a heavy fall during her flight."", ""``First it was machine guns, then grenades, then cannon,'' she said."", ""``Every time I moved and they heard leaves rustling, they shot.''"", 'The massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebears settled in the Drenica  Valley about 150 years ago, was not the first in the conflict that  ravaged the Serbian province between March and October and has now  lulled into an uneasy truce.', 'Indeed, the conflict between Serbian  forces bent on keeping Kosovo in Serbia and guerrillas fighting for  the independence of its heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew  international attention with the massacre of the Jasari clan in early  March by Serbian units at Prekaz, in central Kosovo.', 'But the killing  of the Delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94,  who was burned in his bed, to the slaughter of Valmir, 18 months,  who was found shot, is the most thoroughly documented so far.', 'Human  Rights Watch, a New York-based group, believes the knowledge gathered  so far increases the possibility of prosecutions by the U.N. war crimes  tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.', ""The Hague's prosecutors could  also draw on the observations of diplomats, human rights monitors  and reporters who saw the bodies scattered in the ravine where the  victims were killed before they were buried in shallow graves in the  clan's nearby compound."", 'In other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been  moved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers.', 'Further, family members who survived the assault have described what  they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around Obrinje  as the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from  their headquarters at Likovac, north of here.', 'By then, the Albanian  guerrillas had fled the area around the Delijaj compound, dispersing  after what a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim  Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat with the Serbs.', 'In the days  before Sept. 26, he said, the guerrillas _ caught in a Serbian pincer  movement _ had decided to fight rather than surrender.', 'The fighting  _ sometimes house to house, even room to room _ took an unusually  heavy toll among the Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav  army.', 'He said he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged  with the massacre of the Delijajs.', 'In other major attacks during the  conflict, the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch.', 'In Obrinje,  led by another former officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined  to name, the guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled  grenades.', 'Maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters  that at least 47 Serbian soldiers and police officers were killed  in the fighting between here and Bajince, three miles east.', ""``We took  weapons from 47 Serbs,'' he said."", ""The state-controlled Serbian media  center in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers  were killed in the fighting, including five reservists who died when  their vehicle hit an antitank mine on Sept. 25."", 'The announcement of  10 Serbs killed in one action is unusually high.', 'The practice of taking  violent revenge is a time-honored tradition in the Balkans.', 'From 1991  to 1995, in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to  a far lesser extent, the main victims, the Muslims, avenged World  War II massacres and new blood feuds, driven into killing by leaders  who exploited old conflicts to carve new fiefs for themselves as the  old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed.', 'In this case, it appears, Serbian  vengeance was visited upon the Delijajs.', ""Survivors of the clan said  they had feared an assault on their collection of mud and brick homes  lining a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of Likovac,  the Serbs' base just a mile away."", 'The Serbs had pushed the rebels  out of Likovac in August and the guerrillas had established new headquarters  around Bajince, six miles east of Obrinje.', 'As the Serbs swept down  from the nearby Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that runs  from Pristina to Klina, it was clear that Obrinje would be a target.', 'Most women and children in the area had moved into Apple Valley, where  more than 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors, seeking safety in  numbers.', 'But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that the ravine below  his family compound would be a better hiding place.', 'He said he believed  the women, children and elderly would be spared if the Serbs found  them.', 'As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the  massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself was Bashkim  Delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli.', 'Bashkim Delijaj  said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father.', ""``The  shelling started again at 7 a.m. on Saturday and I saw a tank convoy  approaching, with infantry behind the tanks,'' Bashkim Delijaj recalled  in an interview."", '``I was smoking a cigarette when a grenade fell on  the roof and from a hole in the gate I saw soldiers coming from about  30 meters away.', 'They were in brown army uniforms, had huge knives  or small axes.', ""Many had beards.''"", 'Bashkim Delijaj said he was unable  to carry his father to safety, and did not have the courage to tell  him what was happening.', ""``I told him I was getting the animals out  of the barn,'' he said."", 'He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually  received shelter from a farmer, all the time hearing shooting and  shelling.', 'When the firing had died down Monday morning, he returned  to the compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform.', ""They went to one of the houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem,  33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain, and the  burned torso of Fazli."", ""``I looked in the window of our house and saw  only the bones of my father, which looked like what we learned in  biology class,'' he said."", 'Together, the two men went to find out what  had happened in the ravine.', 'There they found the bodies.', 'First, Ali,  65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with his  own tobacco cutting knife.', 'Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated  in a makeshift tent, his brain placed between two foam mattresses.', 'Then Hava, 65, who was sprawled near the tent.', ""They moved on to find  Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not  far away."", ""Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who was seven months pregnant,  had been mutilated, he said."", 'A little further up the ravine, Imer  said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30.', ""He opened his wife's coat and found  his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recovering at a relative's  home in Likovac."", 'He said he tried to clean the baby and then put her  under his jacket and walked a few feet further to find the bodies  of his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children,  Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7.', 'The corpses of other family members were  found in the woods and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were  found the next morning, Imer said.', 'On Oct. 3, the bodies of two missing  teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found in the bushes  at the side of a road near an abandoned Serbian police compound.', 'Later  in the month, the body of Hajriz was found pushed down a well, close  to the ravine.', 'One uncle, Sharif, who was in the ravine, is still  missing, presumed dead.', 'Human Rights Watch, which has been documenting  the Delijaj massacre, has described it as the most vicious of a pattern  of attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict.', '(To a  lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians,  forcing them from their homes, and allegedly carried out at least  two massacres.)', 'The evidence strongly indicates that the Gornje Obrinje  killings were followed by conscious mutilations carried out after  the victims were killed, a coming report by Human Rights Watch says.', 'Delijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and others  that they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian  police officers during the fighting.', 'They believe that the police  officer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police station, was  used by the Serbian special police officers as a guide to the Obrinje  area.', 'This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group  of ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal to the Serbs,  could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the  war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human rights experts.', ""``The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to identifying  the

pause in the wildfires  that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is  a matter of considerable debate."", ""But many experts cite the confluence  of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the  world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's  long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion  in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand,  Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing  to return."", ""Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly  on markets, Rubin acknowledged that ``in the last several weeks there  have been a number of significant, positive developments.''"", ""But the  former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market  rallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will  take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has  repeatedly called ``the most serious international financial disruption  of the last 50 years.''"", ""In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous  about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new  round of panic, which

really be  big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem.', ""And in Japan the  question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the  money.''"", 'But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese,  Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in  Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not  lack of resources.', 'In Brazil, though, the United States has a better  chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program,  as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso  and his team.', 'But demonstrating economic support will probably require  tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt  administration to help stabilize the dollar.', ""The money is under Rubin's  control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent  congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995."", 'But the reaction  was so strong _ for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for  international bailouts _ that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious  ever since.', ""He committed $3 billion in a ``second line of defense''  in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year,  but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country."", 'U.S. officials  said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse  of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene  there that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S. aid.', 'In the  bailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after President Boris  Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed  the leading reformers _ the United States offered no direct help.', ""Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging  markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles."", 'So far, Brazilian  officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking  about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculators  that it would be dangerous to bet against the country.', 'But at the  same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they  do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get  it.', 'U.S. officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous,  worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will  be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil.', ""``The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,''  said an investment banker involved in the talks."", ""``But the fact is  that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months  the government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which  is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year

chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending."", ""The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary  Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's  austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections  but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that  the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil."",

administration official who deals with economic issues,  speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projections  suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a  figure that he said ``will certainly cut into growth, and could well  become a major political problem.''"", 'Trade deficits carry with them  both good and troubling signals about the economy.', 'The current flood  of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels  in decades.', 'And while sales of American aircraft, computer chips and  other goods are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets  in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American  exporters.', 'But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem  facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some  large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to  make ordinary purchases.', 'The result is such a freeze of economic activity  that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American piers.', ""And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers who can  no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen  who are discovering that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster has  been ruined by the banking crisis."", ""Among the most surprising elements  of Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit  was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst  effects of the global troubles: China."", 'Despite continued growth of  the Chinese economy, exports to China have slowed dramatically and  imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately  seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in  Asia.', 'That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion,  levels previously only seen in trade with Japan.', 'The Chinese _ besieged  by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient  banking crisis _ have signaled to the United States in recent weeks  that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets  further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization.', ""That  amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years  has been using the negotiations over China's entry to the world body  as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and  politically."", ""Ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the  administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration's  China policy, but now officials say privately that the progress is  evaporating."", ""The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American  economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to  lower interest rates two times in recent weeks."", 'So administration  officials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the numbers  as another warning sign, but not a crisis.', ""``While the United States  remains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace  continue to strongly influence the U.S. trade balance,'' Commerce  Secretary Williams Daley said in a statement Tuesday."", 'After China,  the biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August  came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion  has spread through Latin America.', 'Exports to Mexico have remained  unchanged.', 'But imports from Mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly  automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment  _ as American manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening  currency.', ""In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest  focus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary  Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago."", ""Normally, that  would be cited as a sign of continued demand for American products  in Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be  imperiled."", 'The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete  a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help  it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through  Asia, Russia and several other nations.', ""Tuesday the IMF and Brazil  reached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and  next, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections  in Brazil this weekend."", 'But for all these potential problems, the  rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill.', 'Because  the rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment  here, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and Senate  around the country.', 'The only exception has been in regions where the  steel industry is strong.', 'The major steel companies have charged in  recent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products on the American  market at prices well below their costs.', 'The Commerce Department has  begun an inquiry.', ""The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the  deficit rose 15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised  figure of $14.55 billion in July."", ""The department said that the resumption  of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike may  have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM brought  in parts from abroad."", 'The deficit was the highest since the Commerce  Department began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992.', 'Exports, the department said, fell three

 A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.
 Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.
 As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge.
 The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue.
 Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures.

and condoned  the Phalangists' attacks beforehand."", 'But the government investigating  commission held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted  grounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry.', 'Since the 1982  invasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation  of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young  inductees for which Sharon is still often blamed.', ""To many Israelis,  however, the Lebanese incursion was ultimately a risk worth taking,  as it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily and driving its forces  far from Israel's borders."", ""The PLO's defeat at Sharon's hands in Lebanon  led eventually to its renunciation of armed warfare against Israel  and embrace of the peace negotiation process for which

criminal.''"", 'He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions of the return  of even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria.', 'A  secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation

bridge between the traditional  secular right and the new militant religious factions within the Likud  coalition.', 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish  former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday  in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning  over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.', 'With his appointment,

conference  in the Washington area next week.', ""For months, Sharon, who is currently  the minister of national infrastructures, has maintained that redeploying  Israeli troops from more than an

Valley.', 'Netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy  note from Arafat, who condemned the attack.', 'Also Friday, in the continuing  clashes between Palestinian youths and soldiers in the divided city  of Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured by rubber bullets  after the funeral of a Palestinian protester shot dead on Thursday.', 'After Netanyahu made the announcement Friday, an Israeli reporter  introduced a question by stating that Netanyahu had diminished the  political threat from the right wing by appointing Sharon.', ""``Are you  willing to sign on that?''"", 'Netanyahu said.', '``I do not know that.', ""I  do know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or  two people you can never know what will be.''"", 'He was referring to  his razor-thin majority in parliament _ which some analysts perceive  to be his key motivator in appointing Sharon.', ""``More than anything  else, this reflects the political weakness of Netanyahu,'' said Yaron  Ezrahi, a leading intellectual and critic of the prime minister."", ""``He  has recognized that the next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't  want to be seen as contributing to the wave of political violence  that would follow a failure."", ""But he doesn't have the domestic political  power to carry out the big decision on his own.''""]","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.
 His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.
 Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.
 He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.
 Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.

free to find his voice."", 'A member of the Portuguese Communist  Party since 1969, he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario  de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely  to seize power in Portugal.', 'But an anti-Communist backlash in November  1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French  texts into Portuguese to make ends meet.', 'In the late 1970s, he also  turned to novels, publishing three in succession in 1977, 1978 and  1980.', ""But it was in 1982, with ``Baltasar and Blimunda'' (``Memorial  do Convento'' in Portuguese),

Academy noted Thursday."", ""``The insight and wealth of imagination  to which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago's work  as a whole.''"", 'Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition,  the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran, Baltasar,  and a visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heavens aboard a flying  machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory Blimunda.', 'This fantastic story takes place against the very real background  of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands  of men held in the grip of the Inquisition.', ""When the novel was published  in the United States in 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it as ``brilliant''  in The New York Times Book Review."", ""``Mr. Saramago is constantly present  as a voice of European skepticism, a connoisseur of ironies,'' Howe  wrote."", ""``I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility,  caustic and shrewd.''"", ""In his next novel, ``The Year of the Death of  Ricardo Reis,'' which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet  Fernando Pessoa, who appears in it as a ghost, Saramago sets his story  in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale following  the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet-physician."", ""Writing  in The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it ``a rare, old-fashioned  novel _ at once lyrical, symbolic and meditative.''"", ""Saramago, whose  sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation  and conflicting use of tenses, sought a different form of freedom

collide  with the Azores."", 'To the delight of Britons, Gibraltar is left behind.', ""Unsurprisingly, the bitter satire, ``The Gospel According to Jesus  Christ,'' proved controversial, with God shown as using the innocently  human Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance."", ""When a Lisbon jury picked the book as Portugal's entry for a 1992  European literary prize, the country's conservative government vetoed  the choice as blasphemous."", 'It was then that Saramago decided to leave  his small, crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of  Lanzarote.', ""``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' published in the  United States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the  decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the  word ``not'' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal."", ""With this ``lunatic creative act,'' as Edmund White put it in The  New York Times Book Review, he ``totally derails the national saga''  by affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate 12th-century  Lisbon from Moorish occupation."", 'White ended his July 1997 review with  a prescient remark.',

said the  move reflected the worsening outlook for European economies, and wasn't  a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine."", ""``It's not a dramatic step."", ""It wasn't in response to political pressure,''  Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut."", ""``The coordinated rate  cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction  in financial market turbulence,'' he said."", 'But Tietmeyer, head of  the bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut does  not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy.', ""``It's not a shift  from the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy,'' he said."", 'Growth in Europe  has been hit by the Asian and Russian economic crises and turbulence  on international financial markets.', 'Duisenberg has said growth in  the euro area countries next year will be about 2.5 percent, lower  than the 3 percent predicted earlier.', ""China made trading in the euro official Monday,

contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany  and France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment,  stuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the

create jobs, and not pressure him to  cut rates.', 'The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave  no hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance  to political pressure was as strong as ever.', 'So strong, in fact, that  Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared the bank would  delay the decision.', ""``What had been feared was that, in order to

part, which  was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians.', 'The shuttle contains  the second station component.', 'The master alarm blared and red lights  flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday.', 'By  the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic  pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed  the cutoff by a second or two.', ""``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill  Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander."", '``But we do things right.', ""We do things by the book, and we're not  going to cut any corners even if it means just shaving a second or  two.''"", 'The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw  up their hands.', ""Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch  apart: ``We were that close.''"", ""The problem was confined to one of  Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units."", 'The pressure dropped just  long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive  switch, then returned to normal.', 'NASA engineers spent the day examining  the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were  confident it would not reoccur.', ""Endeavour's flight is already a year  late because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in  building the international space station."", 'The one-day delay cost NASA  about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay.', 'Aboard Endeavour  is an American-made connecting passageway named Unity.', 'The astronauts  will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian

 total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates  now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's  estimated lifetime, at $110 billion."", ""Of that, American taxpayers are  to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners  about $14 billion."", ""The station is intended to be a grand laboratory  where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop  new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries,  in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space  flight to

announced Friday.', ""While  putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station  would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old  outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on,  said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager."", ""NASA was  surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed  the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch  of the first part of the new station."", 'Delaying the Nov. 20 flight  by 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in  the subsequent assembly flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable  sun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said.', ""``We have  mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,''  Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center  in Houston."", ""``It added technical complexity and risks to the mission  that were not justified.''"",

""``Both sides concluded that it did not make sense.''"", 'The Russians,  struggling to find money for their space program with their nation  in economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousands of  pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an  economy move.', ""However, some critics questioned the Russians' motives,  wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay  the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have  agreed to do next summer."", 'The Russians have so little money that the  United States and other partners in the international station fear  that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations  with the new project.', ""``The Mir competes with the international space  station for very critical resources and for funding,'' Brinkley said."", ""NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to  use on the international space station, he said, but only if it does  not interfere with assembling the new station."", 'The United States and  15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next  week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and  propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period.', 'The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second  station part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that attaches to  the first module.', ""Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of  the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story  tower in the shuttle cargo bay."", 'It was the first time that the Russian-built  Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever  touched.', 'It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.', ""``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the  moment the two pieces came together."", ""``Congratulations to the crew  of the good ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control."", ""``That's terrific.''"", ""The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy  Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle  robot arm."", ""``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said."", 'Then came the hard  part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay.', 'The two station  pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the  other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her  crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views,  rather than direct line of sight.', ""This was the first time such a ``blind''  docking had ever been attempted."", 'Currie positioned the solar-winged  Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly  above Unity.', 'It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment.', ""Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters,  and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for  the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together."", 'The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific.', 'It took several  tries, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pulled tightly together.', 'The docking ring between them would not retract properly; Mission  Control quickly traced the problem to the attached robot arm and asked  the crew to release its hold on the docked Zarya.', 'That did the trick.', ""The union _ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime  _ set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach  electrical connectors and cables between the two components."", ""Mission  Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned  and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks."", 'But everything  occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from  a piece of space junk that strayed too close.', 'Before beginning their  final approach to Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of  a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California.', 'Mission Control  ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three  miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total  of five miles from the orbiting debris.', ""The smaller gap would have  been ``probably a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control  said."", ""The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture  of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity."", ""The shuttle's 50-foot robot  arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot,  44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched  from Kazakstan on Nov. 20."", 'It will provide all of the necessary electricity  and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control  module can be launched next summer.', ""Minutes after Zarya's capture,  Cabana called down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed  as Russian flight controllers had feared."", ""The antennas must be fully  deployed in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that  system won't be needed before next summer, officials said."", 'The only  other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement  part.', 'The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component,  will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for

phalanx  of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the  arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82,  is not a Spanish citizen.', 'They also maintained that as a former head  of state, the general had diplomatic immunity for actions taken while  in office.', 'His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite  the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could  be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine  soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.', ""On the opposing side, Alun  Jones, a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case,  defended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention  in London."", ""The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was  responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to  destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his  ideological values.''"", ""After hearing the arguments in a court crowded  with

Britain  in hope of the general's early release."", 'But efforts to prevent that  gathered strength elsewhere in Europe.', ""In Geneva, a public prosecutor,  Bernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's  arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean  citizen in 1977."", 'Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation  in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard,  who was 25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared.', ""The prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to  seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva."", 'At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens,  of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90  dictatorship, filed suit in a French court.', 'In addition, a human rights  group in Paris said Monday that it had filed a suit with a Paris court  on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle,

 Pinochet, in London for back surgery, was arrested in his hospital room.
 Spain is seeking extradition of Pinochet from London to Spain to face charges of murder in the deaths of Spanish citizens in Chile under Pinochet's rule in the 1970s and 80s.

 Pinochet supporters say that Pinochet's arrest is illegal, claiming he has diplomatic immunity.
 The final outcome of the extradition request lies with the Spanish courts.

general in central Java, and Camdessus  had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering  the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central  bank."", ""``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled."", ""``He was  told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove  monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.''"", ""At one point, Camdessus

children, and they all  understand.'''"", ""But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to  symbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and  reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical  reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social  costs of its actions."", 'Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement.', ""It was, one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move  that was obvious to everyone except Camdessus.''"", 'Perhaps one reason  why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is

crisis like this one.', ""As a result, the  fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if  its demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly  dissolved."", 'While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and  their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples  to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands.', 'To help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive  subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low.', 'But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked  the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots  that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs.', ""The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials

a major U.S. ally, as a sign  of support and confidence.', 'Mindful of the backlash in Congress when  Mexico was bailed out with U.S. money, that was the last thing the  Treasury planned to do.', 'Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not  forcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough  or disclose their true financial picture.', 'Within the U.S. government  there was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt  the United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when  the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their

whether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia.', ""``We had  to pull Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled."", ""As it  turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the

Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication."", 'By the 1920s, as typewriters became common, typed memoranda started  to be used in court cases.', 'From the 1950s through the 1980s, legal  experts say, there was an explosion of documentation fueled by the  new technologies of electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines,  and then personal computers.', ""And e-mail, they add, has played an important  role in legal inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the  1980s when e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial."", 'But the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government antitrust  investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail has supplanted  the telephone as the most common instrument of communication.', ""``E-mail  has just revolutionized investigations of this kind,'' one senior  Justice Department official said."", 'While under investigation, Microsoft  has handed over to the government an estimated 30 million documents,  mostly e-mail.', 'In the trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000  exhibits, mainly e-mail.', ""And in their e-mail, people often communicate  more frankly and informally than when writing a letter or a report  _ tap it out, punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace."", 'But e-mail  communication is documentary evidence, which in legal cases provides  a rich, contemporaneous record of what people were thinking and planning  at the time.', 'It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony,  so often coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory.', ""``The  e-mail record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response  harder to sustain,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in  the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings  Institution."", 'It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions  in testimony.', ""And that is what the government will do in attacking  Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, taken over three  days in August."", 'The government offered a glimpse of that strategy  on the first day of the trial.', 'It showed a few brief clips of a point  in the deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21,  1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide  the browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the  company, which is its chief rival in that market.', 'In the taped deposition,  Gates says he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates whether  he thought it made sense to invest in Netscape.', ""He said that he was  asked about it after the June 1995 meeting and replied, ``I didn't  see that as something that made sense.''"", 'But in an e-mail on May 31,  1995, Gates urged an alliance with Netscape.', ""``We could even pay them  money as part of the deal,'' he wrote, ``buying a piece of them or  something.''"", ""The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail,  though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft  made an illegal offer to Netscape."", 'To be sure, it is what Microsoft  did _ not what it said in e-mail communications _ that counts most.', ""``But once the e-mail that looks bad gets in the record, you end up  doing what Microsoft's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial  doing _ trying to explain it away,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading  antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP;

not lessen  the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust  suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software.', 'The department  has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly  in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off  competition in other software realms.', ""The Internet has risen so quickly  as an information medium that only four years ago, in his book ``The  Road Ahead,'' Bill Gates scarcely mentions it."", ""In addition, only a  couple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest online service,  was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it  was widely derided as ``America On Hold.''"", 'Now Microsoft has moved  so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing  it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward  to make deals with other Internet players.', ""In its antitrust suit against  Microsoft, the federal government charges that the company has illegally  bundled its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother  Netscape's chances of marketing its browser."", ""Now in the corridors  outside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape  has found a new partner in America Online and has no need of protection  from the government."", 'But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft  has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale  to America Online.', ""Nor is it clear that customers of America Online  will choose Netscape's browser as a vehicle for buying and selling  on the Internet."", ""Even in its newly musclebound form, America Online  remains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement  of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen."", 'It may be that, years hence,  America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative  means to the Internet through telephone lines, cables or the like.', 'But until that day, fairness requires Justice Department action to  insure that Microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer  choice.', 'Only when companies know they can get their products to the  consumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the Internet  into the revolutionary medium it promises to be.', 'America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace  largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to  flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic  mail while checking the weather and sports scores.', 'Now, the company  has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate  executives in pin-stripe suits.', ""Nearly lost in the complexity of America  Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's  announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind  the computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores."", 'Netscape already has created software that made it a player in providing  support for what is already known as electronic commerce.', 'But America  Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software,  consulting and services for online merchants.', ""``Most companies that  sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce  space,'' said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference  Tuesday."", ""``We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end  solution.''"", 'The market is big and growing bigger by the day.', 'Forrester  Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic  commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range  from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores.', 'By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce  services and software should top $35 billion.', ""``E-commerce services  are the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take  advantage of the true business opportunities on the Web,'' said Traci  Gere, an analyst at International Data Corp. ``The market is growing  very rapidly, but it is very fragmented.''"",

well-known information technology consulting companies  such as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen  accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems  for big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting  and consulting separately but under one umbrella.', 'Software companies  like Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with  little or no consulting to help customers use them.', 'There are also  plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic  commerce services.', 'Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, started  basically as advertising and design firms.', 'Others, including U S Web  and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting.', ""In fact, those  two strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending  merger with CKS Group."", ""America Online argues that its advantage in  this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad  subscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software,  plus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's  venture into electronic commerce engineering."",

traffic.''"", 'Despite the advantages Netscape and  Sun bring, analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems  in its new quest.', 'Chief among them is whether it can appear to have  the consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers  demand.', ""``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when  it comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior  analyst with Forrester Research."", 'Its decision to keep Netscape as  a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership  with Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said.', ""``America  Online doesn't look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added."", ""``It looks  like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape  and Sun.''"", 'Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented  companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said,  that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services  that big corporate clients demand.', ""``Telecommunications companies  that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers  have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships,''  she said."", 'Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the  e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to  sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online.', ""``We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar  stores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he said."", ""``They have  an online store, but their square footage is too small.''"", 'Even before  the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic  commerce software and services.', 'It has been rewriting the software  that lets companies open online stores to be based on universally  accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language  used only on America Online.', ""This new software, which now will be  combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available  for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet."", 'Similarly,  it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their  credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases  without retyping all that information each time.', 'America Online is  working to offer it _ for a fee _ to stores on the broader Internet.', 'There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic  commerce.', 'These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies  decide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional  sale in stores.', ""There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed,  ranging from the online stores themselves to connecting those sites  to a company's existing inventory and accounting systems."", 'There are  creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer  list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts.', 'And there  are operational services that involve actually maintaining the big  servers that users connect to when they use the online stores that  display catalogs, take orders and process payments.', 'America Online,  Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather  than back-office functions.', ""``We will consult on how to merchandise  and sell online,'' he said."", ""``We understand the consumer piece of  the puzzle.''"", ""Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic  commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and  hardware."", ""``The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the  best possible solution for their business,'' said Robert Gett, the  chief executive of Viant."", ""``If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun,  their answer is a bit tainted.''"", 'Netscape does have an expanding force  of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming.', 'But they have been most competitive, Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts  projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and  carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web.', ""``They say, `Who knows  our software better than Netscape?'''"", 'Gett said.', ""``We help customers  decide which platform is best for them.''"", 'But America Online argues  that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business  needs.', ""``We always believed that commerce, that is buying goods and  services, is the huge revenue stream of the future,'' Schuler said."", ""``We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg.''"", ""America Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in two  promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another  company _ the Internet

hopes to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal."", ""If the  $4 billion deal is completed _ the companies had not reached a final  agreement as of Monday night _ AOL would acquire a

a telephone interview from America  Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an  enterprise that had ``morphed itself'' from a company dependent on  sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web _ and ``in  Microsoft's cross-hairs'' _ into a business that relied on advertising  and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling  software to corporations to handle electronic commerce."", ""The Netscape  transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault  on its browser business _ a central element in the government's antitrust  suit against Microsoft."", 'Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard  Windows operating system, and gave away the browser for free.', 'The  government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive  practices, while Microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly  to benefit consumers.', 'Early this year, after laying off workers and  suffering a

earned $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal  quarter, which ended in September.', 'Yet America Online has also changed  in the last couple of years, moving well beyond its reputation as  an online service for beginners.', ""It now has an Internet chat service  and runs its own all-in-one site on the Web, known as a ``portal,''  which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and  online shopping."", ""``America Online has really changed from a closed  online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology  company with a diverse set of brands,'' Andreessen said."", ""``These two  companies have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a  good one.''"", 'America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace

a news conference  Tuesday."", ""``We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end  solution.''"", 'The market is big and growing bigger by the day.', 'Forrester  Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic  commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range  from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores.', 'By 2002,

well-known information technology consulting companies  such as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen  accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems  for big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting  and consulting separately but under one umbrella.', 'Software companies  like Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with  little or no consulting to help customers use them.', 'There are also  plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic  commerce services.', 'Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, started  basically as advertising and design firms.', 'Others, including U S Web  and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting.', ""In fact, those  two strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending  merger with CKS Group."", ""America Online argues that its advantage in  this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad  subscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software,  plus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's  venture into electronic commerce engineering."",

traffic.''"", 'Despite the advantages Netscape and  Sun bring, analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems  in its new quest.', 'Chief among them is whether it can appear to have  the consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers  demand.', ""``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when  it comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior  analyst with Forrester Research."", 'Its decision to keep Netscape as  a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership  with Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said.', ""``America  Online doesn't look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added."", ""``It looks  like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape  and Sun.''"", 'Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented  companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said,  that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services  that big corporate clients demand.', ""``Telecommunications companies  that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers  have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships,''  she said."", 'Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the  e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to  sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online.', ""``We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar  stores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he said."", ""``They have  an online store, but their square footage is too small.''"", 'Even before  the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic  commerce software and services.', 'It has been rewriting the software  that lets companies open online stores to be based on universally  accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language  used only on America Online.', ""This new software, which now will be  combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available  for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet."", 'Similarly,  it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their  credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases  without retyping all that information each time.', 'America Online is  working to offer it _ for a fee _ to stores on the broader Internet.', 'There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic  commerce.', 'These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies  decide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional  sale in stores.', ""There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed,  ranging from the online stores themselves to connecting

on  its on-line service."", ""One of the government's allegations in the antitrust  suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main browser for  AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip."", 'To win the browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate on  the Windows desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of personal  computers sold today.', ""Staying with Microsoft's browser can be seen  as proof that AOL still regards placement on the Windows desktop as  crucial, as well as a careful step to avoid undermining one of the  allegations in the government's case."", 'For AOL, the Netscape purchase  would accelerate its evolution toward the Internet.', 'At present, its  flagship on-line service is a hybrid _ to its own

the witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires in  January, he would ``expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft  software.''"", 'Yes, Warren-Boulton responded.', ""``It is not at all clear  to me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed  merger with Netscape.''"", 'He noted that America Online officials had  said their need to be among the online services featured in Windows  forced them to accept Microsoft terms _ establishing Internet Explorer  as the default choice.', ""Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton the question  that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and Microsoft's  larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape-AOL deal."", ""``Surely  this combination,'' he asked, ``tells you something about the nature  of competition in the software industry?''"", ""Warren-Boulton's answer  was probably not the one Lacovara had been after."", ""``To the extent  that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft's actions with  these exclusive contracts and other actions,'' he said, ``it is unfortunate  to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest  star.''"", ""Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is  to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system  software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft  operating system."", ""That is the foundation under most of the government's  case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist  that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition."", ""Through  repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried to make  the case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral."", 'The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested,  that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment _  a point of view the company encourages among its employees.', ""On Friday  and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are  placing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies  _ principally Microsoft's greatest rivals _ are writing software for  these new systems."", ""But Warren-Boulton argued that ``the existence  of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not  mean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power.''"", 'On  Monday afternoon, Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer  Co. is having selling its new iMac computer.', ""He entered into evidence  an Apple news release issued last month showing, among other things,  that 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's new iMac computer had  previously owned a Windows machine."", 'Apple computers use a different  operating system,

the disturbing reports by international aid workers,  who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population  of this highly isolated and secretive country.', 'Among other shocking

stunted  growth.', ""They have discovered that, despite a huge international food  aid program over the past three years, severe malnutrition is widespread  among toddlers at crucial stages of brain

groups like the Red Cross, have begun to document  how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by  a breakdown in public health services.', 'Even basic water purification  systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine,  Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers of people with such severe  diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food  they have.', 'As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly, often grudgingly,  granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six  months, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger  haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys  and observations by foreign aid agencies.', 'Past assessments of the  magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered  flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of  North Korean refugees who had fled into China.', 'And while the researchers  and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence  of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions  that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did  find was in many ways equally disturbing: A population withering after  nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition  that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation  irretrievably lost.', ""``Now at last we have hard facts _ the situation  is very grave,'' said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for  Asia of the World Food Program, which has taken

fall, crews led by foreign scientists were finally  permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random  sample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid  data on the crisis.', 'They found that 62 percent of children under 7  had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition.', 'Thirty percent  of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition.', 'This  means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development,  because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential  first year.', 'The researchers said that available scientific data suggest  that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea.', ""``Even if  the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that  the country will fully recover from what we saw,'' said Judit Katona-Apte,  a senior program adviser for the World Food Program."", ""``People will  be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited  in their mental capacities.''"", 'Likewise, when Red Cross representatives  this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics  where they operate, they found that not one had water that was suitable  for human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation  in North Korea.', ""``But of course they drink it _ they have no choice,''  he said during a recent trip to Beijing."", ""``There is a very close relationship  between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector  that's in very bad shape.''"", 'Virtually all the children under 7 who  are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said.', 'None of the aid groups  has been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the  North Koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts  agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three  million have died prematurely since the food shortages began.', 'But  public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult  to tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick  starvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so  that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an  ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal.', 'Still, there are  some disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted by the World  Food Program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked  by the government, 10 percent had a parent who was dead.', ""In this fall's  independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts sent to eight  of North Korea's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children  under seven."", 'In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had  stunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children  were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their  height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the  study.', ""That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and  puts North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of  malnutrition."", ""While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as  that of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent  malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in some ways  understates the problem."", 'In India and Bangladesh, pockets of severe  poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in North  Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed.', ""``Even in war-torn  countries, famine is more in pockets,'' Dr. Katona-Apte said."", ""``It's  hard to think of another country that's been affected in this way.''"", 'The survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied  only children under 7, the group that received nearly all the food  donated from abroad.', 'After three years of food donations, many foreign  aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries  and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings  are failing.', 'So a month ago, the World Food Program began providing  elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged  7 to 12.', ""``We have reason to believe that many people are suffering  and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting  weaker and weaker,'' Swedlund said."", 'There are now more than 100 Westerners  living in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term  hunger is readily apparent there.', ""``If you walk down the street in  Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three  years,'' Swedlund said."", ""``She may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4.''"", 'Dr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and  the Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean  kindergarten last year.', ""``There were these two children sitting at  a desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin  and they had patchy hair,'' she said."", '``And they were just sitting  there working.', 'This is accepted as normal!', 'They are in school, and  they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation.', ""If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention.''"", 'But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that  option does not exist, she and others said.', 'Many Korean doctors do  not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before  this decade.', 'And, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper  nutritional supplements.', ""Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines,  had no glass to replace broken windows and were ``colder inside than  out,'' having received no coal since 1994."", 'He said that even in hospitals,  sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent,  because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run  water pumps.', 'He said that next year, the Red Cross would start to  address those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients  and $1 million on water treatment.', ""With few other options, vast numbers  of North Koreans have resorted to eating ``substitute food,'' hard  cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans  and sweet potatoes, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks  and straw."", ""``This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,'' Swedlund  said."", ""``It's becoming a regular part of the food basket.''"", ""Doctors  in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating

the United Nations  prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention.', 'Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched  its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission  to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade.', 'As he has so often,  Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of  time and yet still accomplished what he wanted.', ""This weekend, foreign  diplomatic observers in Kosovo reported that a ``military stand-down''  had taken place in the province, where Milosevic's forces have waged  a fierce offensive against Albanian rebels."", ""The observers said that  except for segments of three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav  army were ``home.''"", 'The daily reports of the observer mission, made  up of U.S., European Union and Russian military experts, are one of  the key elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide  whether Milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire.', 'By putting  the army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of Kosovo  and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic  may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said.', 'But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked the  other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo  Liberation Army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo  and its ethnic Albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian  population that supports it.', 'His military operation created more than  250,000 refugees, whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to  take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations.', 'U.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy  who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia,  to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo.', ""The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's  principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province,  and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression  since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who  now seek independence."", 'The West, fearing the precedent that independence  for Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying  to mediate a middle course.', 'In essence, diplomats said they believed  that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year  interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy  arrangement.', ""Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critics  of Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able  to choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian population  into submission with impunity."", ""``The United States and its allies  have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation  Army,'' said Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group,  a policy analysis organization, ``and taken three weeks to discuss  military action, with the result that 500 Albanian villages were destroyed.''"", 'Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to  live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic  took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery  and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose  bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of  large swaths of Kosovo territory, including key roads.', 'While he was  doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington:  he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania  and Macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area.', 'All along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo  conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania  and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause.', 'Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just  three years after peace was secured in Bosnia.', ""Milosevic catered to  Washington's concern that the conflict be contained."", ""The Yugoslav  army mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that  few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for  the rebels."", 'The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was  unsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political  leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose  main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland and Germany.', 'For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim  Rugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter  that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity.', 'For that  procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban  on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month  before.', 'After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military  operations in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again and  carry out the investment ban.', ""In late June, Holbrooke met with two  self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western  town of Junik but then broke off all contact."", 'Clinton administration  officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention  would bolster the separatist forces.', 'To try to put the best face on  the situation, Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept  the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and  report on military action.', 'The monitors were slow in getting organized.', 'By August, when the Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police,  were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages  in the process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to  the fighting.', 'They drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going  on from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise.', 'In recent  days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved,  the monitors say.', 'But there are some areas in central Kosovo around  Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits  because of land mines on the roads.', 'The mines are believed to have  been planted by the guerrillas.', 'Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre  of 18 ethnic Albanian women, children and elderly people on Sept.  26.', 'A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on  Sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police  or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon.', 'The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the  vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, said a report  by New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on Sunday.', 'The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking  civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions.', ""But the violations  by the guerrillas were on a ``lesser scale'' than the government abuses,  the author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded."", 'The report focused  on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police  forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early  March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo.', 'At least 83 people,  including 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which  involved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers.', ""In  the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through  rolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remains  politically secure."", 'That is in part, his domestic critics say, because  diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako  Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature.', ""With NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard  Holbrooke delivered a last-minute warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president  to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes."", 'But Slobodan Milosevic showed no signs of backing down.', ""Following  his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement  denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' that favored separatist  ethnic Albanian guerrillas."", 'The statement, broadcast by government  television, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province  for the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat  to other countries in the southern Balkans.', 'Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate  to the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday  after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior  NATO officials.', 'Holbrooke issued no statement after the meeting.', 'Before  boarding a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke  said conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved  since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air  raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian  separatists.', ""Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic  ``the extreme gravity of the situation.''"", 'Holbrooke negotiated the  peace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that ended the  3 1/2 year Bosnian war in 1995.', ""In Washington, U.S. President Bill  Clinton expressed concern that

in August and with committing  acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.', ""Government officials immediately  announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for  information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another  man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's  chief military commander."", 'Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan  under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement  that rules that country.', ""Atef's whereabouts are unknown."", 'Prosecutors  also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June, that included  similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden.', 'That indictment  was returned before the embassy bombings and was the result of a two-year  investigation into his activities in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as  well as reports that he had connections to a circle of Islamic militants  in Brooklyn.', 'The new indictment, which supersedes the June action,  accused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989  to the present, in which he was said to be working in concert with  governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist  groups, to build weapons and attack American military installations.', ""But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement  in the embassy attacks."", 'The indictment does not, for example, specify  whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders  to those who carried out the attacks.', 'Nothing in the document indicates  why the original indictment was kept secret for months, but the secret  charges were returned about the time that American officials were  plotting a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden.',

that country."", ""No details were given about  whether the alleged deal with Iraq led to the development of actual  weapons for bin Laden's group, which is called Al Qaeda."", ""The government  said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used private relief groups  ``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al Qaeda."", 'The groups were  not identified.', ""Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted  internal investigations of its members and their associates, trying  to detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those  who had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the organization.''"", ""The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin Laden's  activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant,  who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons  and explosives, helping to buy land for his training camps and assisting  in running his finances."", 'While the June indictment against bin Laden  suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his  dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges  are an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve  the embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.', ""Ms. White  said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and carrying out the most  heinous acts of international terrorism and murder.''"", ""Citing the more  than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks and the more than 1,000  wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense, all of the citizens of the  world are also victims

carrier and dozens  of armed police.', 'The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since  the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August,  there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State  Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks  against the installations.', 'The latest and most disturbing account  suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department  received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little  to strengthen security at the embassy.', 'The pattern of negligence demands  examination by the Clinton administration and Congress.', 'Shortly after  the bombing, the department acknowledged that the American ambassador  in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy  be moved to a safer location.', 'Her advice was rejected.', 'On Friday,  Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times reported that  an Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombings  outlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence officials last November.', ""Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said terrorists  were planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground  garage _ that it called for more than a temporary increase in security."", 'Unhappily, it was discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the  embassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and  defeat.', 'The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain  to relatives of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack nearly  identical to the plan Ahmed described.', 'Since the bombings, the department  has been quick to close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent.', ""It would be interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decisions  was any more credible than Ahmed's warning."", ""No one at the State Department  is happy with the department's handling of security matters, but the  tendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening."", 'Of course, additional money would have made it possible to harden  defenses at more embassies, and Congress has now added to the security  budget.', 'But more decisive leadership in the department could have  assured preventive steps were taken in East Africa.', 'Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications  for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies  in Kenya and Tanzania.', ""A federal prison official said Monday that  the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows  prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts  of violence and terrorism.''"", ""A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's  office declined to say whether the authorities foresaw further threats  of terrorism."", ""But the law allows officials to impose restrictions  where they believe there is ``a substantial risk'' that an inmate's  communications ``could result in death or serious bodily injury.''"", 'Under the provision, approved by the Justice Department, prison officials  may segregate prisoners from other inmates, and cut off their correspondence,  visits, interviews with the news media and use of the telephone.', ""It  was not clear yesterday which of these restrictions would be applied  to the two bombing suspects, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed  Daoud al-'Owhali."", 'The rule does permit communications with their lawyers.', 'A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two  men are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the country  being held under the restrictions.', 'The total population of federal  prisons exceeds 108,000 inmates.', 'Others similarly

Center bombings in 1993.', 'Michael  A.', ""Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he was ``somewhat concerned  because these are pretrial defendants, after all.''"", ""``You can't punish  them in

39,"["" The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most  aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing  out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court  rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to  support their opposing arguments."", 'Whatever the outcome of the trial,  scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an  almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of  bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines.', ""The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that  controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today."", 'The  government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business  practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable  to the vicissitudes of a single company.', 'Microsoft asserts that the  case is intended to give the government control over which features  can be added to Windows.', 'However grand the economic stakes, the legal  dispute is narrow.', ""The government says that Microsoft's contracts  with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access  to the Internet illegally stifle competition."", ""The contracts prohibit  manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator  browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer."", 'They also prohibit them  from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites  on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners.', ""Microsoft's  contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with  businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored  treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links  on the Windows desktop."", 'In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has  voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate  them at will.', 'Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because  they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet  access.', ""The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer  with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows  98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers  of one product to purchase another."", ""The contracts with manufacturers  and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they  are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but  to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems."", 'The  latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department.', 'Browsers  have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software  platform on which other programs run.', 'So contracts intended to drive  browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly.', 'Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department  is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and  no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary.', ""Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist  of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s,  says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact  it is ubiquitous."", ""No one, he said, ``would challenge the right of  manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile  or buttons to shirts.''"", 'His point, shared widely among economists,  is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results  in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover  development costs.', 'But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power.', 'The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing  good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute.', ""Microsoft  says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes  what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it  offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage  to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers."", ""The Justice  Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle:  yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough  to balance possible long-term harm to competition."", 'So which test of  consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws?', 'The simple answer is that  no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite  the same cases without fear of embarrassment.', 'Consider a 1985 case,  Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case,  Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States.', ""In the first, Aspen Skiing,  the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist  _ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands,  a competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs."", ""When  Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues  shriveled and the rival sued."", 'The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing  had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action  helped consumers.', 'In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper  in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised  on a new radio station.', 'Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the  exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers.', ""Indeed, in  Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business  with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department,  which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside  its own."", 'But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that  in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because  they offered no consumer benefit.', 'The courts, he argues, never pounced  on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service.', 'Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits  against hypothetical long-term harm.', ""Rule argues that Microsoft's  practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits."", ""Besides, he says,  unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's  contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser  or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals."", 'In truth, though,  neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product  design.', 'In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No.', '2 et al.', 'vs. Hyde,  another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized  that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service.', 'Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not  be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists  if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately.', ""That  principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence  of Windows and Explorer requires bundling."", 'But Microsoft will point  to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard  for the government to meet when it alleges tying.', 'Microsoft will also  draw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change  the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors  to attach peripheral equipment.', ""But perhaps Microsoft's best argument  is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which  the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the  basis of a balancing test."", 'The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer  clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products.', ""The Justice  Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust  law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices  that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out  competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow."", 'The Justice Department  will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least  exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide  customers.', ""Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's  restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test."", 'But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped  or hurt is up for grabs.', 'A balancing test would have the courts weigh  the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet  sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus  the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers  and operating systems.', 'But a test that makes good sense in theory  can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice.', ""``Balancing tests  are impossibly difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell,  R-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University."", ""``The  practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft  almost certain victory.''"", ""Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts  agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing  test toward a simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts."", 'Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended  to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist  to raise prices later.', 'Microsoft will have an easier time defending  itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing  its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that  its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good.', ""The  antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division  under President Reagan, is littered with ``contradictory, ambiguous  and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts."", 'He and other legal experts agree  that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for  the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the  spine of the antitrust law.', ""Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy?"", 'Until  last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft  Corp., as a genius and innovator.', 'A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled  visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal  computer.', 'Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice  Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates.', 'In  an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man  whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal  computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian schemer  who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.', 'Product  innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates.', ""Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition  and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the  government sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of  payments by the Microsoft chairman."", 'It also sought to cast Gates as  an obsessed man who feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp.  and its potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet  browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web.', 'Gates  was portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies as a schoolyard  bully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness  that is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator  and high-technology guru.', ""According to a document presented by Boies,  for example, Gates asked America Online executives in 1996: ``How  much do we need to pay you'' to damage Netscape?"", ""``This is your lucky  day.''"", ""The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant,  and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, makes  as many ``offers you can't refuse'' as needed to achieve its goals."", ""Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint  that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from  the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public  will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive  business tactics and the company's software."", ""``Despite what you're  reading in the press, people judge us by our products,'' said Mich  Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office."", ""``Our  experience is that people vote with their pocketbooks.''"", 'So far, consumers  are casting positive votes.', 'Last week Microsoft reported quarterly  profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the  level a year earlier.', 'Despite the record profits, some marketing experts  say that if the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style  robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer.', ""``When you  have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really  the driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert  at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at  Berkeley."", ""``There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's  brand recognition.''"", 'Already there are early warning signals, as political  cartoons in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week.', ""One showed him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my  way, I'll take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft  chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window  while a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, ``I'm sorry, but Mr.  Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows.''"", 'But some industry  analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who knows how to play  hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company.', 'The he-said,  she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases  both in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked  in a legal battle with its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed  by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that  goes on in professional sports.', ""``It's like taking what Charles Barkley  and Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court'' and turning  it into something more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews,  co-author with Stephen Manes of ``Gates'' (Doubleday, 1993)."", ""Indeed,  there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has  so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon  Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates'  tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep."", 'In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity.', ""Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students  at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's  suit was roundly booed."", 'BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y.

Explorer passes  what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it  offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage  to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers."", ""The Justice  Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle:  yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough  to balance possible long-term harm to competition."", 'So which test of  consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws?', 'The simple answer is that  no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite  the same cases without fear of embarrassment.', 'Consider a 1985 case,  Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case,  Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States.', ""In the first, Aspen Skiing,  the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist  _ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands,  a competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs."", ""When  Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues  shriveled and the rival sued."", 'The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing  had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action  helped consumers.', 'In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper  in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised  on a new radio station.', 'Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the  exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers.', ""Indeed, in  Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business  with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department,  which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside  its own."", 'But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that  in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because  they offered no consumer benefit.', 'The courts, he argues, never pounced  on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service.', 'Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits  against hypothetical long-term harm.', ""Rule argues that Microsoft's  practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits."", ""Besides, he says,  unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's  contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser  or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals."", 'In truth, though,  neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product  design.', 'In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No.', '2 et al.', 'vs. Hyde,  another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized  that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service.', 'Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not  be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists  if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately.', ""That  principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence  of Windows and Explorer requires bundling."", 'But Microsoft will point  to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard  for the government to meet when it alleges tying.', 'Microsoft will also  draw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change  the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors  to attach peripheral equipment.', ""But perhaps Microsoft's best argument  is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which  the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the  basis of a balancing test."", 'The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer  clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products.', ""The Justice  Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust  law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices  that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out  competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow."", 'The Justice Department  will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least  exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide  customers.', ""Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's  restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test."", 'But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped  or hurt is up for grabs.', 'A balancing test would have the courts weigh  the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet  sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus  the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers  and operating systems.', 'But a test that makes good sense in theory  can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice.', ""``Balancing tests  are impossibly difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell,  R-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University."", ""``The  practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft  almost certain victory.''"", ""Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts  agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing  test toward a simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts."", 'Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended  to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist  to raise prices later.', 'Microsoft will have an easier time defending  itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing  its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that  its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good.', ""The  antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division  under President Reagan, is littered with ``contradictory, ambiguous  and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts."", 'He and other legal experts agree  that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for  the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the  spine of the antitrust law.', ""Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft  Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge  of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon  Valley executive."", ""The executive recalls telling Klein that unless  a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little  effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer  industry."", ""Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's  concerns."", ""But he said time was running short and the strongest evidence  in hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications  Corp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating  the Internet."", ""``This is a Netscape case,'' the executive recalls Klein  saying."", ""But five months later, the case that the government is bringing  to trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war  to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as ``a broad  pattern of anti-competitive conduct'' by Microsoft."", 'Netscape, the  government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but  only one of several examples.', 'The 12-person witness list for the Justice  Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence  added to the case since May.', ""James Barksdale, Netscape's president  and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by  executives representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology  companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer,  America Online and Intuit."", 'In bringing a more ambitious, complicated  case to trial than the one it filed in May, the government has chosen  a high-risk strategy.', 'The law states that new evidence can be added  to a suit after it is filed, but not new charges.', 'And so, in his federal  courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far  afield from the original suit.', 'But if the government wins its broadened  case, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on  Microsoft.', ""In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal  treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser."", 'But the  government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on  remedies, if it wins the case.', ""The remedies under consideration now  include more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices _ perhaps  even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen Microsoft's grip  on computing."", ""That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform  that Microsoft's foes would applaud."", ""``The government has doubled  the bet and doubled the stakes,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at  the Harvard business school who is co-author of the book, ``Competing  on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.''"", ""Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed  as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June that threatened  to undermine the antitrust suit."", 'That ruling came in a separate case,  involving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft  signed with the Justice Department in 1995.', 'In the June ruling, a  federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser  with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them  one product.', ""The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion  in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the  operating system were two separate products, bundled together and  given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market."", ""``With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the heart  of its case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in the  Justice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft."", ""``So it  has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything  it can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has had for years  _ into the gun barrel and see what hits.''"", 'The June appellate ruling  did shake the prosecution team.', 'But mostly it strengthened the hand  of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the  case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation.', 'At the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation  moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule  approved by the court.', 'Speed was a priority from the outset, they  say.', ""The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May  to move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced  in June."", ""While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government  lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as  PC makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft's  Windows operating system, which functions as the central nervous system  for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold."", 'The key allegations,  government lawyers note, have not changed since May _ namely, that  Microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to  defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets.', ""``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the  May filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case."", ""``The real game plan was always to get a broader case.''"", 'What is more,  one person noted, the prosecution team was not at full strength until  shortly before the suit was filed.', 'David Boies, a renowned courtroom  litigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who  successfully defended IBM in its 13-year confrontation with the government,  was named as special counsel for the Justice Department last December.', 'But Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time  for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing  private cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller.', ""The antitrust  suit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape story, mentioning  Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the  complaint and a supporting memorandum."", ""But it also prominently mentioned  Microsoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an  Internet programming language, and cited it as an ``example'' of Microsoft's  behavior."", ""``It was crafted as a template that could be added to without  much stretching,'' one person involved in the case said."", 'And so, as  new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, Klein step  by step approved the widening of the case, the person said.', 'And that  explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been  in the hands of the Justice Department for years has been added to  the case since May; only after gathering new evidence did it become  apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case.', ""For example, the government has added the contention that Microsoft  pressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner  of Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and Internet  software because they might conflict with Microsoft's plans."", 'The government  contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two  companies three years ago, especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which was  attended by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the  Microsoft chairman.', ""Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft  episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by Steven McGeady,  an Intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written  by him on Aug. 28, 1995."", ""The memo, still under court seal, said that  Gates ``made vague threats'' and was ``livid'' about Intel's investments  in the Internet ``and wanted them stopped.''"", ""A handwritten note, also  under court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as saying  that Netscape is their ``common enemy'' and that Intel's role should  be to ``fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy.''"", ""These  documents were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's office in  San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative  Demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on Intel on Nov. 10, 1995."", 'On its  own, the Intel material was intriguing, but it became part of the  antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to  the case said.', 'The government is contending that Microsoft also tried  to urge Apple to stop selling its Quicktime multimedia software in  the Windows market and tried to convince Real Networks Inc. to pull  back in the market for so-called streaming software.', 'The government  case has also broadened, people involved in the case say, as more  witnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify.', ""``In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the  government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward,''  one person said."", '``But as the strength of our case was perceived to  improve, more people were willing to come forward, and things snowballed.', ""You get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and so on.''"", ""The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest  independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic  administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators."", 'But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated  public policy.', 'Nor, by all accounts, of politics.', ""Instead, like the  software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft has  taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled  or predicted back when it started in 1989."", ""It was in November of that  year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las  Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd  been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM  _ which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry."", 'The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal computers  and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software _ were collaborating  on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2.', 'But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows.', 'The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system  was going to become the new standard?', ""With Gates standing uncomfortably  at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that  the two companies wanted to ``clear the air.''"", 'OS/2 was the future,  he said.', 'As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product  for under-equipped computers.', 'Windows, he asserted, would never receive  all the advanced features of OS/2.', 'Gates certainly did not look happy.', 'But he did not disagree.', 'The news conference got little attention,  just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications.', 'But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer  with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles,  in Byte magazine.', ""``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified  vision of graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and  it looks sort of like a U.S. economic model,'' divided into lower-,  middle- and upper-class products."", 'As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft  were colluding to divide the operating-system market _ a potential  violation of antitrust law.', 'Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation  of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft has  been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators  for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month  after month, year after year, for the last nine years.', 'Now comes the  antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity  of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different  investigative inquiries during that nine-year span.', 'Microsoft, today  the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market  value of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust  target.', ""Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton  administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?''"", 'the  answer seems to be there is none.', ""In interviews, more than a dozen  current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of  the government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's  antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations."", ""As for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division  operates independent of the administration's political considerations."", 'Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust  division during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington  lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft.', ""``When  I was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White House was  punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided  to do."", ""There was no communication between antitrust and other branches  of government.''"", 'Asked if he believed that policy had changed under  the Clinton administration, he said: ``Not really.', ""I've seen nothing  to suggest it.''"", ""Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and  in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's  technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case,  he said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter,  civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without  any political contact.''"", 'Klein said, by way of examples, that he might  discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with  the Defense Department or Transportation Department.', ""``But never the  White House,'' he said."", ""``For a significant case, we might call the  White House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press  conference.'"", ""'' ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added,  ``was the Dita Beard-ITT case.''"", 'Mrs.', ""Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp.,  was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000  donation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long way''  toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the  Nixon administration's Justice Department."", 'The authenticity of the  memo was never proved, and Mrs.', 'Beard always denied writing it.', ""In  any case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been immaculate.''"", 'In  the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President  Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment.', 'In answer to a question during  a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton  said: ``I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters  within the Justice Department.', 'At this time, I do not think I should  depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will  have a big impact on an important sector of our economy.', ""But I have  to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way  the antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter.''"", 'Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly  at least.', 'And Gore, who generally represents the administration on  technology issues, has never commented at all.', ""In Rule's opinion,  the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it  were politically acceptable to do so."", ""``It would be a little odd for  the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit,''  he said."", '``It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake.', ""I  would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that.''"", 'Taking  sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly  since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political  donations and support.', 'In fact, the present and former government  officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the  inquiries conducted during the last nine years.', 'They began at the  FTC.', 'Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff  opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question.', 'But as has happened  so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial  inquiry irrelevant.', 'Microsoft abandoned its agreement with IBM, and  Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained  a cipher.', 'But as that issue faded, once government investigators began  looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them.', 'In  1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed Microsoft that  the investigation was being expanded.', 'The agency, his letter said,  was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant  position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other  areas.', 'That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit.', 'One  former senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence  in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had  to approve any suit, might have a different view.', ""``We knew the commission  might have difficulty with a monopolization case,'' the former official  said."", ""``They hadn't brought a case in years.''"", 'And in fact, in 1993  the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal  charges.', 'The deadlock served as a dismissal.', 'Then, a few months later,  the Justice Department decided to pick up the case.', ""``It was farther  along than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert Litan, a former senior  official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now  at the Brookings Institution."", ""``Usually a case would be two or three  people complaining and a few documents,'' he said."", '``But this was  a fully researched record.', ""They gave us the files and briefed us on  what they had done.''"", 'The Justice Department lawyers picked up the  same thread.', ""``The general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said,  ``was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating  systems to cement a monopoly in other areas.''"", 'In 1995, Microsoft  and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company  promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft  operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every  computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed.', 'The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product  to the sale of another.', 'The charges in the present suit are similar  in many ways.', 'Even with the agreement, the government investigations  continued.', 'That same year, Justice Department investigators showed  up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first time  to ask questions about their next line of inquiry.', ""``America Online  had been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive recalled, ``because  Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,'' a competing online  service, ``with Windows.''"", 'Once more, market forces overtook the investigation.', 'The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America  Online prospered and grew.', 'But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled  the void.', 'In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general  who headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get complaints about  Microsoft all the time.', 'We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints  center.', ""And we take them very seriously.''"", ""In 1996, Netscape's first  complaint arrived."", ""In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape  said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating  systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's  browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed  by Netscape."", ""The next year the Justice Department formally charged  Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows  to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers."", ""``It  seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,'' a natural  extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department  by then."", 'A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court  panel overturned that ruling this summer.', 'In the meantime, last May  the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their  new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday.', 'It contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other  predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations  and investigations of the last nine years.', ""``A good part of this case  is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I,'' in the early  in the 1990s, Litan said."", ""Or, as the former senior FTC official put  it, ``there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through  here.''"", 'But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled  and spun by hundreds of different hands.', 'The legal tool that the government is using in its assault on Microsoft  Corp. _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable.', 'The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy  has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending  on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts.', 'Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger  brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act  was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the  industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads.', 'Farmers, laborers and  small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts  as vehicles of concentrated power.', 'But the trusts, large national  holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization  and industrialization.', 'Economists at the time opposed the Sherman  Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise.', ""No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in  Matthew Josephson's ``The Robber Barons,'' explained that nearly everyone  agreed that ``something must be flung out to appease the restive masses.''"", ""The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention ``conspiracy,''  ``restraint of trade'' and ``attempt to monopolize.''"", 'Yet while the  Sherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition,  it never uses the term.', ""After it was passed, critics of the trusts  derided the ``impenetrable'' language of the Sherman Act and called  it the Swiss Cheese Act."", 'But by the early 1900s, the political climate  had changed.', 'The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as  income gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore  Roosevelt, who became president in 1901.', ""``The Sherman Act has always  been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived  exploitation and the aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor  at the New York University Law School."", 'The model trust _ and the principal  target of the trustbusters _ was Standard Oil.', 'Shrewdly, Roosevelt  made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their  superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result  of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices.', ""Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained  about the company and the business practices of its founder, John  D. Rockefeller."", ""But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned  to light the nation's homes _declined steadily."", ""So Standard Oil, it  could could reasonably be argued, was an ``enterprising monopoly.''"", 'In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United  States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price  war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face  genuine competition.', 'When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil  monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company  swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard  Taft.', 'The federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and  the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911.', 'Standard  Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes.', 'Both were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft  chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller.', ""``But there is no  presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction  in the Microsoft case,'' said Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a  best-selling biography of Rockefeller."",

nation's antitrust laws  a century ago."", 'On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape an illegal  offer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion  pact that Netscape rejected.', 'Microsoft replies that the prosecutors  are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and  that the company has never tried to divide the browser market.', ""Bill  Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did not attend  the Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by telephone with the  Microsoft team."", ""Two people who did attend that June meeting have been  named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week: Netscape  president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager  of new technology."", 'In the trial, the government will contend that  Microsoft presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according  to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation.', 'Relying  heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president  Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors are  expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements,  both incentives and requirements.', ""Microsoft, according to the people  questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15  to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune  Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run  better on Windows."", 'In return, the people say, Netscape would give  Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft,  give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts  and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating  system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995  meeting.', ""And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied  it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business  negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows  ``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links that enable  other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating  system."", 'By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have  that preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft  fiercely denies making.', ""Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive,  told a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was  ``the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business.''"", ""Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's  money and its endorsement."", ""Netscape would have also been free to sell  its browser for use in earlier versions of Windows and for use on  other operating systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful  system used mainly in corporations and research labs."", ""``But if we  had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped aside, the best  we could have hoped for was becoming a company with sales of $100  million or so and hoping to be bought out by Microsoft,'' said Clark,  a former computer scientist at Stanford University who founded Silicon  Graphics Inc., a computer graphics pioneer, before starting Netscape."", ""``We didn't start Netscape for that.''"", 'For any company, a meeting  with Microsoft is often a charged affair.', ""Every computing device from  keyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to  browsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system."", ""This is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use, but  it also gives Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper."", ""And  since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond  the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position  of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against  it."", ""And in the software industry, where every program is rendered  in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition  and cooperation are often blurred."", ""The talk about that line at the  Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating  system _ the ``platform,'' in computer terms _ and the application  programs, sometimes called ``solutions,'' that run on top of the operating  system."", ""The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris  Jones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, ``admitted that  Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete.''"", ""Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly  of the company's clarifying its position."", 'If Netscape stayed on the  applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies  could be partners, Microsoft said.', 'But if Netscape tried to become  a player in the platform space, they would compete.', 'Microsoft released  portions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the  government had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context.', 'Q.', 'Do  you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of  Microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence  Netscape not to compete?', 'A.', 'Absolutely.', 'But again, persuade in the  sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have  a great business relationship together.', ""Later in the deposition, a  Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft  executives intended to suggest that ``there would be any consequences  to Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform  direction you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.''"", ""Jones replied: ``The conversation was something like the following:  `We're in the platform business."", ""We're going to invest heavily in  this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies."", ""That's a done deal.'"", ""And we're asking them: `What is your business?"", 'Is your business platforms or solutions?', ""If it's platforms, we're  in the platforms business."", ""We're competing.'''"", 'Microsoft portrays  such comments as innocuous statements of fact.', 'But to Netscape, the  same remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat.', 'This is  because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an  alternative platform to the Windows operating system.', ""The browser,  sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as  the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming  for starting other software applications."", ""In addition, Netscape's  browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running  Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems  Inc., a Microsoft rival."", ""In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform  could replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing."", ""Indeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to  relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath  the browser."", 'By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape  as a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown  jewel.', ""On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal  Wave,'' Gates wrote: ``A new competitor `born' on the Internet is  Netscape."", ""Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing  them to determine which network extensions will catch on.''"", ""Netscape's  strategy, Gates wrote, was to ``move the key API'' into the browser  ``to commoditize the underlying operating system.''"", 'THE BROADER INQUIRY:  GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the states  have recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding  evidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other  companies to squelch competition.', 'They say that like the Netscape  meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft,  which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors  and partners.', 'One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend,  was an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development  of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with  Netscape.', ""Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips  that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run  the Windows operating system."", ""Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft  are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred  to as a single, powerful entity, ``Wintel.''"", 'But Intel also employs  hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs  in Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they  have also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace  at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal  computer industry, which they dominate together.', ""Federal and state  investigators have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work  being done by Intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in  no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif.,  headquarters on Aug. 2, 1995."", 'The contentious session was attended  by several executives from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and  Intel chairman Andrew Grove.', ""An internal Intel memo stated that Gates  made ``vague threats'' about supporting Intel's competitors and that  he was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in the Internet and wanted  them stopped.''"", 'Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and  Internet software development.', 'Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president  who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a  witness for the government.', ""Microsoft replies that the government's  accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful  distortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and  witnesses."", ""The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter  failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely  meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will  work well with Windows."", 'Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on  to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology  or a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape.', ""In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser  market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps."", ""To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month  and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, ``Competing  on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,''  which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape  executives."", 'The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape.', ""But its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard  Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless."", ""``Microsoft's  take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation  from competitors, the government and even customers,'' Yoffie said."", ""Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added,  ``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did  without crossing the line as much as it did.''"", ""THE SPYGLASS LINK:  REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20  Microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the  company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash."", 'The subject was the Internet  and how it might revolutionize the computer software business.', 'Few  concrete plans were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist  that a direction was set.', ""``Our vision from the outset was to unite  the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet,'' said Steven  Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting."", 'Yet Microsoft  badly trailed Netscape in the browser field.', 'To hasten its entry,  Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc.  of Naperville, Ill.', 'The first meeting between the two companies was  initiated by Spyglass in April 1994.', 'At the time, it was a tiny company  and eager to do a deal with Microsoft.', 'Spyglass was selected as the  commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National  Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois.', ""In the summer  of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of  Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago."", ""The two men talked  in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class  passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, ``We're going  to take Microsoft head-on.''"", ""At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking  to himself, ``Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from  me.''"", 'Today, he noted: ``Remember, we were a company with a couple  dozen people and almost no money in the bank.', 'Netscape had Jim Clark,  with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing  from Silicon Valley.', ""Netscape had a very different agenda.''"", 'By July  1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology,  Colbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement  the following December.', ""Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him  that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating  system, but its timing was accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise."", ""``Microsoft  was initially hoping to charge for the browser,'' Colbeth said."", 'But  on Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply  integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away.', 'The announcement  caught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise.', 'At the time, Spyglass  had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including IBM and  Digital Equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing  revenue stream of about $20 million a year.', ""As a result of Microsoft's  move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller  Internet software companies went out of business and big customers  shifted to Microsoft's free browser."", 'Spyglass slashed its payroll  and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace  its lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually.', ""``Whenever  you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can  someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put  you out of that business,'' Colbeth said."", ""THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY  SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market  continued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though  its browser was free."", ""Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed  that Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader."", ""In April 1996,  Netscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the  Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer,  according to Zona Research."", ""So the biggest personal computer maker,  Compaq, thought it made sense to give customers Netscape's browser  instead of Microsoft's."", 'But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and  Compaq had no choice but to give in.', ""In June 1996, Compaq wanted not  only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but  also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was  delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95."", ""Microsoft informed  Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would  lose its license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director  of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators."", ""The  ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed,  ``Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement.''"", 'Faced with being  denied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course  and kept the Internet Explorer icon.', 'Microsoft asserts that Windows  and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone  defines what is in the product.', 'Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft  adds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies.', ""While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily  hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer,  Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that ``to take  one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft  as an arrogant company is unfair.''"", ""Noting that a Compaq executive  is a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, ``We are totally dependent  on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq.''"", 'At Netscape,  however, the Compaq episode was a watershed.', ""``That was the singular  act that got me going to the Justice Department,'' Barksdale recalled."", ""Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to  buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product,  the Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and absolute proof  that Microsoft was a monopolist.''"", 'After investigating the incident,  the Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft  was illegally tying the sale of one product to another.', 'Microsoft  replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating  system.', 'And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows  and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated,  as they are now in Windows 98.', 'Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no  product-tying violation of antitrust laws.', 'In a separate case, a federal  appeals court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the  company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and  declare it a single product.', ""But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted  to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most  industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different  software programs."", ""``It took a long time for the integration strategy  to play out,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher."", ""``Back then,  integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows.''"", ""THE `BALANCING  ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen  Case refers to dealing with Microsoft as ``a delicate balancing act.''"", 'That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of  1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured  place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip.', ""To gain  access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed  to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online  subscribers, who now number more than 13 million."", 'Yet throughout 1995,  as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant  improvement ever in its operating system, Case was knocking on the  door of the Justice Department.', 'His complaint was that Microsoft was  going to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct  competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of  Windows 95, which was introduced in August.', 'This bundling tactic of  using the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network,  or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young  but fast-growing online business.', 'The Justice Department listened  and investigated.', 'But ultimately, the government decided against taking  any action.', ""At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft  was both feared and loathed at the time."", ""America Online had a designated  ``Microsoft watcher,'' a young M.B.A. who tracked its adversary's  every move."", 'Above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture  of Gates.', ""Beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words  ``THE ENEMY.''"", 'Though America Online was the clear leader in the online  services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault  by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft.', ""When he had visited  the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled,  Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying he could  buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business  on his own and ``bury you.''"", 'A threat or merely a statement of the  facts?', ""``A bit of both,'' Case said recently."", ""``But he was mainly  articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.''"", 'Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to  cooperate.', ""With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide  Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve,  had to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own  services."", 'America Online had its own browser, but to keep pace with  the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape  or Microsoft.', 'For both software companies, a deal with America Online,  which had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge  in browser use and market share.', 'Netscape seemed the natural partner  for America Online, since both companies were Microsoft rivals.', 'On  March 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology,  but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula.', ""The next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with  Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser  America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked  for Netscape's Navigator."", 'To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give  America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely  the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had  asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft.', ""``After we agreed  to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled  on the Windows desktop,'' Case said."", ""``It was an example of Microsoft's  pragmatic side.''"", 'The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate  goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay  software business.', 'As a result, its new online service, MSN, would  have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival,  America Online.', ""``It was Bill's decision,'' said former MSN general  manager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates."", '``He sent me e-mail  on it.', ""He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much."", ""I disagreed  with him.''"", 'To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different  view of the likely impact on MSN.', ""He told senior vice president Brad  Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would  amount to ``putting a bullet through MSN's head,'' according to a  deposition taken by the Justice Department."", 'In the antitrust suit,  the government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft  used the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser  war against Netscape.', 'David Colburn, a senior vice president of America  Online who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is  a witness for the government.', 'Today, Microsoft has overhauled its  Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest  Web sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing  and news.', 'And it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search  features, in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN.com.', ""``I still  regard Microsoft as a primary threat,'' Case observed."", ""``Microsoft  has a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no  reason to think it won't in this business as well."", ""We will always  be in Microsoft's cross hairs.''"", ""THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER  At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is  one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible."", ""``Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson  learned,'' observed Clark, the Netscape chairman."", ""Silicon Valley's  venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's  high-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days."", 'Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper.', 'For while competing directly  with Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an  engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation.', ""And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship  with Microsoft."", 'For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft  entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which  has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising  technology and people.', ""``Microsoft understands start-up innovation  and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech  company,'' said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners,  a venture capital firm."", 'As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be  seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes  the business environment, like a weather front.', ""``Microsoft is incredibly  pervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates,  a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings  of the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always  come up, he said: ``One is the price of the company's stock, and the  other is what Microsoft is going to do.''"", 'In the last few years, Microsoft  has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior  Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists.', ""The meetings  are part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations  with Silicon Valley."", ""``We work hard to provide clarity about where  we're going and where we're not going,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's  chief financial officer."", ""Last year's conference took place in October  at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the  Wall Street of high-tech venture investing."", ""Maffei led a team of five  Microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists,  one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the  minds of many of his peers: ``How do I invest in a company that stays  out of the way of the steamroller?''"", 'Maffei, recalled one person who  attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses  that Microsoft was likely to avoid.', 'His list included specialized  software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided  design and others.', ""But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry  appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms  that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system."", ""At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture  Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems  and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  &AMP; Byers, and said quietly, ``I guess that leaves us washing machines  and toasters.''"", 'Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two  business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in  the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week.', 'But judging from  an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states  that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments  in the book as well.', 'To cite one example, Microsoft contends that  its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer  browser are a single integrated product.', ""In its suit, the government  asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled  together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications  Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World  Wide Web."", ""In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and  Its Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management  and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft  executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's  browser was it integrated with Windows."", 'Microsoft hurried its first  browser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch  up with Netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with Internet  Explorer 3.0, which was introduced in August 1996.', 'In that version  it changed its software design to use programming modules, or components,  that could be put together and rearragned like building blocks.', ""In  the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted as saying,  ``IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser,''  He added, ``We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform.''"", ""The timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government  cites as evidence requests before August 1996 by personal computer  makers that wanted to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead  of Microsoft's browser."", 'Microsoft denied the requests, insisting its  browers and Windows were a single, integrated product.', ""Microsoft's  legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month,  by issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who was given a confidential  copy by the authors to review."", 'Microsoft has also sought the transcripts  of 44 current and former Netscape employees interviewed by the authors.', 'A federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to that  research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling.', 'The new  book, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster,  is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the  start of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19.', 'But already, a few quotes  from Netscape executives have leaked out.', 'The authors decided to send  the complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news  organizations Monday, so that the material could be read in context.', ""Microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that Netscape's  troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any  alleged predatory practices by Microsoft."", 'The book does detail where  Netscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too often and running into  obstacles in its software development efforts.', 'In private antitrust  suits, the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is  an established defense.', ""But legal experts say that defense may well  be far less effective in a federal case in which the government is  seeking court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices rather  than the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private  cases."", ""``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes  is a total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official  in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the  Brookings Institution."", ""``But Microsoft has a big legal team, and it  seems they are working on every defense they can find.''"", 'The book  quotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as saying the company  bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from  America Online Inc.', 'But that was a second-chance to do a deal with  America Online, the leading online service.', ""The government's case  focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose  Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft  agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main  Windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing."", ""For a  book entitled ``Competing on Internet Time,'' it is intriguing that  one of its central themes is that Netcape got too wedded to the notion  that the Internet revolution would change everything quickly."", ""Microsoft,  by contrast, stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled  the company, the authors write, to ``mesh its short-run tactical plans  with a broader strategic view of how to win the war.''"", ""The book quotes  Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying, ``The fact of the  matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three  months."", ""The organization also can't."", 'You can ship products quickly.', ""But you can't say, `Oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three  months.''""]","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.
 The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.
 The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.
 The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.
 The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.
 An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.

anti-abortion  violence at various clinics.', ""``It's fair to say that when investigating  these events, we will look at any connection between individuals engaged  in criminal conduct,'' Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department,  said."", 'Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have  tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian.', 'They are  mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their  movement.', 'In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering  other possible explanations for the killing.', 'Some say they believe  that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a  personal experience with abortion.', 'Others wondered whether the shooter  had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing  more abortions.', 'The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents  are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient.', ""One idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently displayed  on their Web site, suggests that the killing was the result of a plot  by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before  last week's elections."", ""Mrs. Hayes says she doesn't know the truth."", ""``There are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the  clinic because we are drawn to the same place,'' she said."",

provides abortions was  someone ``who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the  situation.''"", 'Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of  abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder  their efforts.', 'When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought  new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel  pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said.', ""``In  many cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and leading  rosary marches'' against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said."", ""``But with Father  Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel like we  were doing something sacrificial as a group.''"", ""Mrs. Hayes said that  she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she  heard women speak about ``choice'' in regard to abortion."", ""Then she  saw ``Silent Scream,'' a well-known anti-abortion film that purports  to show the footage of an abortion."", ""``What I saw was the end of life,''  she said."", ""She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where  she encouraged women ``not to kill their child.''"", 'She also began to  house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics  where abortions were performed.', 'Mrs. Hayes looked at her 3-month-old  daughter, Bernadette, then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant,  a sonogram taken at 13 weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door.', ""She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone  else's child."", ""``Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been  a partial-birth abortion,'' Mrs. Hayes said, referring to a controversial  late-term abortion procedure."", '``They have the hardest time getting  the shoulders out, so they can get to the head and puncture it.', ""``It's  brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby?"", ""There's  no question that these doctors are trying to murder a child.''"", ""The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated  the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it has not eliminated  women's access to abortion."", 'That is because the availability of abortion  in the Buffalo area, as in much of the United States, is a complex  reality, one affected by class and education, medical training and  the personal convictions of individual doctors.', 'Knowledgeable middle-class  and affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy  can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists, or  if a gynecologist has a personal objection to the procedure, through  a referral to a colleague.', 'Women who are poor, young or uneducated  and have no such regular relationships with doctors have to rely on  specialized clinics like the one Slepian worked in, or on hospitals.', ""It is this group _ for whom unplanned pregnancies are far more common  than for prosperous women _ that faces a shrinking universe of possibilities  as a result of the fear set off by Slepian's killing and the slayings  of five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993, medical experts  said."", ""``If you're well off and well connected, you can get your abortion,''  said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for clinical ethics  at the University of Buffalo, which trains doctors for the Buffalo  area's hospitals."", ""``For everybody else, it's less and less available.''"", ""The number of abortions in the United States has been declining steadily  since the first years after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision  legalized abortion in 1973, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute,  which studies reproductive issues."", ""They now number roughly 1.5 million  a year, according to reports by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according  to the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion  group, which calculates its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures."", 'The number of providers who identify themselves as performing abortions  as part of their practice is diminishing as well.', 'A 1994 Guttmacher  study, the last one published, found that the number had decreased  18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908.', ""Moreover, the  study said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency programs routinely  offer training in abortions during the first trimester, though many  do offer elective courses."", 'Laura Echevarria, director of media relations  for the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that  most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating  miscarriages that are similar to those used for performing abortions.', 'Only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New York  does the availability of abortions continue at a steady level, experts  say, though even in these locales there is concern about the decreasing  number of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully trained  in performing abortions.', ""The Guttmacher Institute, which keeps the  nation's most precise statistics, said that in 1992, the last year  for which it has figures, there were 142,410 abortions in New York  that were done by just 151 providers, including 61 hospitals and 44  clinics."", 'Still, that provider figure greatly understates the number  of private doctors who perform them in their offices, medical experts  say.', ""``Many obstetricians and gynecologists in Manhattan provide abortions  as part of their palette of services, and have for many years,'' said  Dr. Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of Planned Parenthood."", ""``Rich and middle-class women have always had access to abortions,  and they always will.''"", 'The major threat to availability in the city  is less a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training.', ""``The bottom line is that we're facing an impending shortage of physicians  who are adequately trained and willing to do the procedures,'' said  Dr. John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the American  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists."", 'But the lack of training  programs is also a result of political pressures on hospitals and  universities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear.', ""``Physicians tend to lie low,'' Choate said."", ""``They don't publicize  the fact that they do them."", ""If they do them, they do it quietly out  of fear for their practice and for their lives.''"", 'One development  on the horizon that is expected to change the outlook for abortions  substantially is final federal approval, expected next year, of the  RU-486 pill, the drug that ends an early pregnancy without the need  for surgery.', 'When the pill was introduced in France and in Edinburgh,  Scotland, Hausknecht said, the number of surgical abortions plummeted.', 'Federal authorities investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician  who performed abortions have identified a Vermont man as a material  witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his  arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning.', 'The man was identified  as James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was in St. Albans,  Vt. His whereabouts are not known, investigators said.', ""Investigators  said Kopp's car was seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett  Slepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion  clinic had long made him a target of harassment, was killed."", 'Kopp,  according to police records and abortion rights groups, has often  moved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics,  and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods  of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions.', ""Denise O'Donnell,  the U.S. attorney for the western district of New York, said Kopp  was not considered a suspect at this time but was believed to have  information material to the case."", 'She declined to give details on  what evidence was being sought from Kopp, describing it only as information  that is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise  the ongoing investigation.', ""Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed  for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person has information  that is important to a case."", ""``If Kopp is found, he would be arrested,  brought to Buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence,''  Ms. O'Donnell said."", ""``Then, most likely, the individual would be released.''"", 'Slepian, 52, was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on  Oct. 23, shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue.', 'He was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons  when the bullet crashed through a back window.', 'He died two hours later.', ""Law enforcement officials said Wednesday's announcement of the material  witness warrant was in part an attempt to underscore the potential  danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of Remembrance Day, a  Canadian holiday that falls on Nov. 11 and that the authorities have  associated with some anti-abortion crimes."", 'At the same time, the Justice  Department and the FBI were trying to find ways to step up the federal  response to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the Slepian  killing.', 'The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would  soon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the  visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local  jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort  focused on abortion clinic violence.', 'Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials,  including Robert Bryant, the deputy FBI director, have met with physician  and abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance  federal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies.', 'Federal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task force  in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor.', 'The unit, which was  charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed,  spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence.', 'The unit  disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy.', ""Law enforcement  officials said that the unit's operation did help reduce violence  at abortion clinics and that, in part, the decision to re-establish  it was prompted by Ms. Reno's desire to send a renewed message to  anti-abortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate  these crimes."", ""Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper  attacks on abortion doctors in Canada and western New York, dating  from 1994."", 'None of the attacks have been solved.', 'Bernard Tolbert,  special agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo, said at a news conference  here Wednesday that investigators had not determined whether there  is a link between the five killings.', ""``There's a possibility they  could be linked, but certainly no information,'' he said."", ""Tolbert  gave little information about the subject of the material-witness  warrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier,  with the Vermont license plate BPE216, was seen near Slepian's home  beginning several weeks before the murder."", ""``We don't have any idea  of where he is,'' Tolbert said of Kopp."", ""``We are looking for him every  place we can, every place he might be.''"", 'A photograph of Kopp taken  in January 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around  the United States and Canada.', 'The National Abortion Federation has  sent out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search  for Kopp, said Melinda DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices,  the clinic where Slepian worked.', 'She said naming Kopp a material witness  in the case had not brought relief to the nurses and other workers  at the clinic.', ""``I don't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic  feel differently,'' she said."", ""``I don't want anybody to relax and  say, `Oh God, they got the guy.'"", ""That's easy to happen."", ""I still want  people to be very vigilant.''"", 'The clinic is the last in the Buffalo  area that is performing abortions.', 'Slepian was one of only a handful  of doctors in Buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure  in the face of pickets, protesters and threats.', 'Since his death, doctors  from outside Buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing  abortion services.', ""On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence,  the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of  an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last  month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions  or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994."", 'The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five  similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats  and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James  Charles Kopp, who is wanted for questioning as a witness about the  Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian.', 'Five days after the shooting,  the Spectator received a package containing an antiabortion flier  with biographical information about Slepian, including a photograph  of him that had been crossed out.', ""``It certainly causes us to be more  interested than ever in speaking to Kopp,'' said Inspector Keith McKaskill  of the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United  States task force investigating the five shootings."", 'Even as they searched  for Kopp, federal officials were also looking into three letters that  were received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in  Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago.', 'Those letters, saying they contained  the deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats  to clinics that provide abortions.', 'All the letters appear to be hoaxes,  and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five  shootings.', 'Kopp is not a suspect in the shootings.', 'An itinerant antiabortion  activist whose last known address is in Vermont, he is the subject  of warrants on both sides of the border.', 'In Canada, he is suspected  of administrative violations of immigration law; in the United States,  he is wanted as a material witness in the Slepian case.', 'Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying  physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break,  most people.', ""There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage  cans at his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the  grocery store aisle."", 'Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients  as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby  killer.', ""Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a  week, pickets shouted epithets like ``pig'' to his face."", 'Slepian,  an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor  by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain.', 'He might crack an occasional  joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and  on weekends.', 'Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an  anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar  demonstrator outside the clinic.', ""So when he was killed Oct. 23 by  a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in  the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern  of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York  state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that  Slepian's work could arouse such

 Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.
 Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.
 Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.
 The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.

 At least 60 died, mostly from smoke inhalation, and about 150 were injured.
 The actual capacity of the 2nd floor dance hall was 150.
 Forensic experts are having success identifying the burned bodies but the question of how the fire began is still unanswered.
 The blaze gutted the entire building owned by the Macedonian Association.
 Mostly immigrants attended the dance.
 The fire squads say they lost about six minutes while trying to respond to a call in poor Swedish.
 It is doubtful a quicker response would have made a difference.

more taxes and  less spending.', 'Republicans, for the most part, opposed tax increases  and favored cutting spending on social programs.', 'Democrats wanted  to raise taxes, especially on the rich,

policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global  warming, immigration and the census.', 'In Congress, there is no consensus  on these matters.', 'So the only way policy could be set was to wrap  them into the giant spending bill.', 'It may be more pleasant to debate  policy than money.', 'But it is probably harder to find a way to split  the difference.', 'As long as the surplus lasts,

unless the premier resigned immediately."", 'Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure  the government.', 'The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit,  who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had  encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans  from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid.', ""Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV channels  which showed a videotape he had made to explain his version of the  story before his detention Monday evening for questioning about the  bidding."", 'Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs  600 million.', 'The government suspended the privatization last month  after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly  between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici.', 'On that earlier tape, Cakici  was heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders.', 'It was  not clear who made the tape, which got into the hands of an opposition  deputy.', ""Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement  in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead  with the bidding."", ""Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing  Yigit's ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender."", ""Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation  national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing  to his center-right Motherland party in elections next year."", ""Milliyet's  sale to Yigit was canceled after the scandal."", 'Cakici was arrested  in France in August.', 'Turkey has requested his extradition.', 'Last month  State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations he had been in  close contact with Cakici.', 'A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal,  President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing  politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form  a new government.', 'Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times  in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a  government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament.', 'He also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the  date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer

ultimate power in Turkey,  have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that  they do not want a quick election.', 'They fear it will produce a Parliament  just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented  Virtue Party as the largest bloc.', ""The commanders are also hoping to  exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister  Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom  they trust, from posts in the new government."", 'Ecevit must now try  to build a government that includes their center-right parties but  not them as individuals.', ""In a meeting this week the country's senior  policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military  officers have a strong say, set three

Turks who complain about the continued dominance  of a geriatric political elite here.', 'He is 73 and has been in politics  for most of his adult life.', ""Early in his career Ecevit emerged as  a spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden masses."", 'Perhaps more than any  other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate  where leftist sympathies were often considered subversive.', 'At the  same time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist.', 'He was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to occupy northern Cyprus  in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on Cyprus.', 'He is also  uncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish nationalism.', 'During his  terms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined  efforts to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then  called the European Economic Community.', 'He considered it an instrument  of capitalist exploitation.', 'Ecevit has also disturbed the United States  by flirting with anti-Western ideologies.', 'In the early 1990s, during  an interval when he worked as a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and  wrote a series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein.', 'He recently  called for better relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains  some of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism  that he developed in the 1960s.', 'The Democratic Socialist Party, which  Ecevit heads, is a closely held family fiefdom.', 'He and his wife carefully  screen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty  to Ecevit is suspect.',
