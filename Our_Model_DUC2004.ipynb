They could hardly  be meeting in a more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued  trading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls  on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly  on investment from overseas. In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister,  Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy  that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion.  Mahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy-  makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would  retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out  when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise. Now, though,  Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate  that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund  economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and  there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again.  ``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls,  the economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director  of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research  organization here that helped draft the policies. ``But we want to  see whether this is strongly sustainable.'' Critics said it was predictable  that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy.  Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows  and currency fluctuations, they said, the government had been able  to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. Still, the  mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results  guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting. With  Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital controls will  have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin  of Westerners. ``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,''  said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. ``There is  no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to  muzzle him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China. Policy-makers  in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit  is seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the  region, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it. So far, Indonesian  officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised  by the International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity  and open markets. But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy  for Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, has advocated using them as an emergency  measure. Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention  that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial  system. He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge  fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive  consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in  Greenwich, Conn., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on  Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted  a flight of capital out of that country. ``The LTCM fiasco really  provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,''  Yusof said. With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia  was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy. In addition to  growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade  balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods. Foreign investors  have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as experts had predicted  they would. While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to  $142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the  period from January through September _ it did not dry up completely.  For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarming  one. They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely  due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian  currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated  by Sept. 30. The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in  September, despite several reductions in interest rates. So the consumers  who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into  their savings, which means the buying spree will end when their savings  are depleted. ``The argument was that by imposing capital controls,  you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the  supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch,'' said K.S. Jomo,  a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here.  ``But that's not happening.'' The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy,  Jomo and others said, is its timing. With the Asian crisis more than  a year old, much of the foreign capital that was in the country has  already gone. The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors  without even locking in the ones who used to be here. ``There is a  case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls,  but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one,'' Jomo said. In fact,  other Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht,  have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency  and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. Analysts  liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that  has come and gone. More important, the capital controls are slowing  down much-needed corporate and banking reforms. The government's rescue  of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is going  ahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually  scrap the much-criticized plan. The rescue of politically connected  companies remains a tense issue here. On Monday, during the trial  of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges  of corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's  claim that he had approved the bailout. Anwar's sensational trial  is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled  from politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with  his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he  dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls. During boom  times, Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner  language. In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying  foreign currency traders ``are the cause of the currency turmoil,''  adding: ``They spread it worldwide. They precipitated the current  recession in every country.'' But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has  stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia. With  protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this  city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order  to soothe the country's agitated population. ``Things will heat up  if the economy does not improve,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor  of political science at the University of Malaya. ``Then the whole  question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue.'' In  that regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in  two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host. \n","2\n","file:  Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region  advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms  in their effort to restore stability. Among the necessary steps is  for countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make  them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests, the  officials suggested. The deputy finance ministers and deputy central  bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila  Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote  regional economic stability. Many of Asia's economies have plunged  into recession since that agreement. Collapsed currencies, weakened  demand and higher unemployment now characterize a region that once  boasted some of the world's highest economic growth rates. The worsening  financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week's summit  in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation forum. The summit is to take place on Nov. 17-18. In a  joint statement, the officials cited risks including slower global  growth, with particular mention of Russia's worsening economy, and  the need to speed up social programs to help the poor in the worst-hit  countries. Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International  Monetary Fund, noted that some countries have already reformed their  banking sectors. But he stressed the need for corporate restructuring  as well. ``These are not easy things to do,'' he said. Meanwhile,  Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that the country's prime  minister would declare ``a state of emergency'' after the APEC meeting  ends in Kuala Lumpur, a report said Sunday. Former Deputy Prime Minister  Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct,  made the warning in an interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine.  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September, saying he  was morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from Malaysia's ruling  party. Anwar denies the allegations and says they were fabricated  because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister's  17-year rule. \n","3\n","file:  The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world  leaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.  Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample  local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit.  It's expected to be a hot affair. Spicy delicacies on the menu are  satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik,  chicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and  fried rice ``village-style,'' the Star newspaper reported in Monday  editions. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia  Marsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the leaders  were expected to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18. APEC groups Australia,  Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,  Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,  Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam  and Peru will also join APEC this year. \n","4\n","file:  Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic  planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry  said Friday. Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders  summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation  from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said.  Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the  understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an annual formality  that allows Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host  to avoid controversy with China. Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's  annual meeting if Lee attends has forced him to send a stand-in every  year since the inaugural summit in 1993. China claims Taiwan as a  breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed  to send their heads of state. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,  Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore,  Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will  join in November. \n","5\n","file:  The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement  for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next  month in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any  time. But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's  job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision  was not expected quickly. The party leaders, who have been conducting  a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar  was fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High  Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.  The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday,  aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform has  the most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had  groomed Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from  his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds  he was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy  and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year  rule. Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks  of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and  Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows police  to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and  lawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked  by the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent  weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding  riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons,  arresting more than 100 people. ``They decided that the government  should be brought down through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama  news agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island.  He was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the  UMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised  face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly  from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised  the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia  next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's  visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated,  the Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying.  Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered  hospital checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four  charges of abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation.  His trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings.  He has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another corruption  count and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in prison and  a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each  sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the  Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial. Under the  same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates  and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 had been released.  The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top candidates  for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper,  which is close to the government, listed the favorites as Foreign  Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak.  Other top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin,  a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as  ``special functions minister'' in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah  Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh  Hamzah, a former finance minister, were also in the running. \n","6\n","file:  Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific  leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of  Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported  Sunday. Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia  for an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph  Estrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. ``I'm very concerned  over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated,'' Habibie was quoted  as saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation. ``I'm concerned  because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed  a lot for the benefit of his country.'' Anwar is a charismatic politician  who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir  on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began  speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has  been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia  law, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political  persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised  and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international  attention to his case. ``Because of human rights involved _ and I  think it is universal _ people should be given the chance to defend  themselves,'' Habibie was quoted as saying in the interview conducted  Saturday. ``People should not be tortured.'' Habibie said Anwar's  dismissal should not have been based ``on things which had not been  proven.'' On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult  for me.'' But he said he would consult parliament, adding, ``I'm not  coming personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia.''  Like Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president when  Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international  affairs circuit. \n","7\n","file:  The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned  to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements  in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Ambassador Jose Brillantes  said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday  after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President  Joseph Estrada. ``They expressed their concern about what's happening  and the statements coming out of the Philippines,'' Brillantes told  radio station DZXL in Manila. Brillantes said he explained that following  the 1986 ``people power'' revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand  Marcos, Filipinos' react ``strongly'' to ``real and perceived violations  of human rights.'' ``I just explained our culture to them,'' he said.  Anwar was fired as deputy premier in September and later arrested,  appearing in court with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace. He  says he was beaten by security guards. Estrada has expressed support  for Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend, and indicated he may  not attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month.  He has also said Anwar should be held in house arrest during his upcoming  trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied  the charges, calling them politically motivated. On Thursday, Estrada  told Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, to tell her father ``not to waver  because he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian people.''  He said, however, that his support is personal and moral and not meant  to interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia. Brillantes said:  ``The expression of personal opinion is allowed in our culture and  it is not surprising for that to happen.'' He also said ``there is  no connection'' between Anwar's case and the summit meeting in Malaysia  of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ``We still consider,  as expressed by our president, that APEC is important to us,'' he  said. He did not say how the Malaysian officials reacted, but he said  he was not reprimanded. Meanwhile, a group Philippine legislators  said they plan to attend Anwar's trial, which opens Nov. 2. ``We feel  that being observers to his trial will be our silent statement of  our democratic aspirations for all Asia,'' the group said in a statement. \n","8\n","file:  The last time the Asia-Pacific region held its annual summit to promote  free trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy  wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis. Canada, the  host country, was criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on  demonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler at the  time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy  were the envy of the planet, joined everyone else in urging countries  such as Thailand and South Korea to bite the bullet and comply with  the tough economic reforms that the International Monetary Fund was  demanding. My, how the challenges have grown, as the 21-nation Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum prepares for its November summit in Malaysia.  Japan _ the world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial anchor  _ is suffering through its worst recession since World War II, and  that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto,  who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, was driven out of power by a violent,  pro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth most populous country  is in real trouble financially. Wall Street is now coping with a steep  downturn. And even though Clinton has promised to attend the APEC  meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while facing an impeachment  inquiry back home, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse  still, Asia's economic crisis is showing signs of going global, and  more and more economists are criticizing the IMF for the way it is  handling its bailouts. Other well-respected economists are going even  further, questioning whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave  some countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators.  In fact, Malaysia isn't the only country trying self-defense mechanisms  such as capital controls. Hong Kong recently spent a fortune investing  in its stock market to ward off speculators. And Washington is trying  to figure out what to do with hedge funds after watching its Federal  Reserve help bail out a major one that was going under, and seeing  the investments of others send the U.S. dollar into a tailspin against  Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,  who made one of his typical anti-free-market comments during last  year's summit, probably could have opened this year's with an ``I  told you so.'' But even he is having major domestic problems. Mahathir,  72, who is widely credited with creating modern Malaysia during his  17 years in power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor,  in an apparent dispute over how to battle the country's economic mess.  Instead of stepping aside, Anwar launched a reform movement across  Malaysia that quickly led to big rallies demanding that Mahathir step  down. The prime minister used riot police to thwart the protests,  and jailed Anwar, charging him with corruption and sex crimes, and  scheduling his trial for Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupted during  the Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and  his reform movement already have been criticized by APEC members such  as Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States. President  B.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada  consider Anwar a friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plans to  attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador  for APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy for APEC members  to meet in Malaysia as the Asian crisis ``ricochets around the world  with no clear sign what will happen next.'' But he also said the leaders  of the 21 APEC members should aim for a productive meeting. Wolf said  such gatherings give members a chance to discuss IMF bailout strategies  and the free-market philosophy, to resolve bilateral disputes, and  to continue to reduce tariff rates to help struggling countries improve  their exports. ``This has been a lousy year in general. It has affected  all of us. It has set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet to  solve the crisis right away,'' said Wolf. ``But we should welcome  the chance to work together and to develop a sense of what's possible.''  So far, APEC has been criticized for doing little during the financial  crisis. But next month it hopes to complete a plan that would lift  trade barriers in nine key industries: environmental products and  services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods,  chemical products and telecommunications. Besides the United States,  APEC, which accounts for half of all global trade _ consists of these  members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,  Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,  Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. During the Malaysia meeting,  APEC also will include three new members: Russia _ one of the latest  victims of the financial crisis _ Vietnam and Peru. \n","9\n","file:  After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and  Indonesian presidents were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific  summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend  Anwar Ibrahim. Both presidents have hinted they might not attend the  meeting of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month  in the Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar. The former deputy  prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia was arrested Sept.  20 on corruption and illegal sex charges, then brought to court with  a black eye and bruises. Philippine President Joseph Estrada told  business and political leaders in Singapore on Tuesday that he had  not made up his mind. Estrada called Anwar his friend and said, ``I  think all of us here believe that due process and human rights should  be respected.'' Indonesian President B.J. Habibie may also stay away,  his foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after the two new Southeast  Asian leaders held a half-hour private meeting. If Habibie passes  up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because ``he has difficulty leaving  the country while there is no vice president, while there are so many  problems to deal with.'' Habibie has already canceled a state visit  to Malaysia, citing difficulties at home. The meeting was delayed  for almost 90 minutes when a mechanical fault was discovered in one  of two Indonesian helicopters that were to have flown Estrada and  his entourage through heavy rain from Singapore. A ferry was chartered  for the 45-minute sea journey. Habibie apologized when Estrada finally  arrived at the Melia Panorama Hotel. Estrada replied, ``That's all  right.'' The two men, who have each been in power less than five months,  met alois June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass a fairer  share of the country's wealth. Habibie took office May 21, hours after  his predecessor and mentor, Suharto, was forced from power after national  protests and street riots over Indonesia's collapsing economy. \n","10\n","file:  A group of high-powered U.S. investors in Southeast Asia on Monday  applauded efforts to perk up Thailand's staggering economy, saying  they had been assured by top Thai officials that key economic reform  packages will soon be approved. After meetings with Thai Cabinet members,  including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members of the U.S.-ASEAN  Business Council said they were confident in the future of Thailand's  economy and promised their companies would continue to invest here  and elsewhere in the region. ``We would be quick as observers to applaud  the aggressiveness of the reform packages that we see being proposed  in front of your government today,'' said business council chairman  George David, who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies  Corp. Thailand was hit hard by last year's Asian economic crisis,  and the proposed economic reform legislation focuses on resolving  the massive bad debt of private companies, which is hindering a recovery.  ``This is very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive,'' David  said, adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promised  Parliament would pass reform measures in ``months, not years.'' The  U.S.-ASEAN Business Council is a private organization comprising about  300 U.S. companies with substantial investments in Southeast Asia.  David said the five executives in the delegation represented dlrs  300 billion in assets. The council's lobbying efforts with the U.S.  and Southeast Asian governments have concentrated on removing tariffs  and other barriers to overseas trade. The delegation will travel to  Kuala Lumpur for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov.  14-18. David said free trade should be a focus of discussions among  the government leaders attending. ``What I hope they will say at APEC  is a very strong affirmation of the free-trade agenda and a very strong  affirmation of the foreign direct investment agenda,'' he added. \n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:gensim.models.base_any2vec:under 10 jobs per worker: consider setting a smaller `batch_words' for smoother alpha decay\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["****************************\n","gsum: [\"Prospects for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum scheduled for Nov. 14-18, 1998 in Malaysia were cast in doubt in September when the Malaysian Prime Minister fired and then arrested his deputy and expected successor who was very popular at home and abroad.
